/**
 * Rewrites the compact `as:Public` / `Public` CURIE appearing in activity
 * addressing fields (`to`, `cc`, `bto`, `bcc`, `audience`) to the fully
 * expanded `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public` URI.
 *
 * Several ActivityPub implementations, Lemmy among them, match these
 * fields as plain URLs without running JSON-LD expansion, and silently
 * drop activities whose public addressing appears in CURIE form.  This
 * helper works around that gap.
 *
 * For documents whose `@context` is drawn entirely from Fedify's
 * preloaded context set and includes the ActivityStreams URL, the
 * rewrite is applied directly: the content of every preloaded non-AS
 * context is known not to redefine the `as:` prefix or the bare `Public`
 * term, so the semantics are preserved by construction.  Any other
 * shape (an inline object, an unknown external URL, and so on) is
 * treated as potentially unsafe and gated on a JSON-LD equivalence
 * check; both forms are canonicalized with URDNA2015 and the resulting
 * N-Quads are compared.  When they differ, the original document is
 * returned unchanged.  Canonicalization failures also fall back to the
 * original document.
 *
 * When no `contextLoader` is supplied the helper falls back to an
 * internal loader that resolves only the URLs in Fedify's
 * preloaded-contexts set and rejects every other URL without issuing a
 * network request.  That behaviour is deliberately narrower than
 * `@fedify/vocab-runtime`'s `getDocumentLoader()`, which after its
 * `validatePublicUrl` check will happily fetch non-preloaded URLs: the
 * helper is reached from verification paths (`verifyProof()` /
 * `verifyObject()`) that operate on inbound, potentially adversarial
 * JSON-LD, and a default loader that fetches attacker-supplied
 * `@context` URLs on the caller's behalf would be an SSRF vector.
 * Canonicalization failures against the restricted loader fall back to
 * the original document, same as any other canonicalization error.
 * Callers that genuinely need the remote-fetch loader (for example
 * applications that sign local JSON-LD against a custom vocabulary)
 * should pass a `contextLoader` explicitly.
 *
 * Must be called before any signing step that canonicalizes the
 * compact form byte-for-byte (for example, Object Integrity Proofs
 * using the `eddsa-jcs-2022` cryptosuite), so the signed payload
 * matches what is sent on the wire.
