/**
 * Dereferences an FEP-ef61 portable IRI through its gateways.
 *
 * Gateways are tried one by one until one of them returns a single-node
 * document whose `@id`, if any, canonically matches the requested IRI and
 * which passes `verifyPortableObject`.  When there is no gateway to try, the
 * document loader is asked for the portable IRI itself, and its result is
 * validated the same way.  If the `response` option is given, only that
 * document is validated, and nothing is fetched.
 *
 * @returns The parsed object, or `null` if no valid object was retrieved and
 *          `suppressError` is set or the failure was a rejected object
 *          (unless `crossOrigin` is `"throw"`).
 * @throws {TypeError} If `gateways` has an invalid entry (always), if no
 *                     verifier is given, or if the IRI cannot be turned into
 *                     a gateway URL (unless `suppressError` is set).
 * @internal Technically exported for generated vocabulary classes, but not
 * part of the public API contract.  This is not considered public API for
 * Semantic Versioning decisions.
