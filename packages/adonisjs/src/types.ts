 * The "register pattern" interface used to configure the context data type of

 *
 * Fedify threads an application-defined value — `TContextData` — through every
 * dispatcher, collection callback and inbox listener.  Because a package cannot
 * know that type in advance, an application declares it by augmenting this
 * interface once, usually in `config/fedify.ts`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * declare module '@fedify/adonisjs/types' {
 *   interface FedifyTypes {
 *     contextData: { user: User | null }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * After that augmentation, {@link ContextData} resolves to the declared type
 * everywhere in the application, including inside `ctx.federation`.

/**
 * The context data type of the current application.
 *
 * Resolves to whatever {@link FedifyTypes.contextData} was augmented to, and
 * falls back to `HttpContext | null` when the application has not augmented
 * anything.
 *
 * The `| null` half of the default is deliberate and important.  Fedify invokes
 * dispatchers and inbox listeners from two very different places:
 *
 * - During an HTTP request, where an `HttpContext` exists, and
 * - From a background queue worker or an Ace command, where one does *not*.
 *
 * Defaulting to a non-nullable `HttpContext` would let application code write
 * `ctx.data.auth.user` in an inbox listener and only discover at 3 a.m. in
 * production — once a real server delivers an activity through the queue — that
 * there was never an HTTP context to read.  The nullable default forces that
 * case to be handled at compile time.

 *
 * This mirrors the `ContextDataFactory` type exported by the other Fedify
 * integration packages (`@fedify/express`, `@fedify/hono`, `@fedify/koa`, …).
 * Like Hono's and Koa's variants — and unlike Express's, which only receives
 * the request — it is handed the whole framework context.
 *
 * That context is a *pre-routing* one, though: the factory runs in the server
 * middleware stack, before route matching and every router middleware, so only
 * `ctx.request`, `ctx.response`, `ctx.logger` and `ctx.containerResolver` are
 * set.  `ctx.auth`, `ctx.session`, `ctx.bouncer`, `ctx.params` and `ctx.route`
 * are still `undefined` (`ctx.params` is `{}`), and dereferencing one fails
 * every request the middleware does not bypass.
 *
 * The ordering is forced rather than chosen: Fedify has to decide whether it
 * serves a request before AdonisJS routes it, and `Federation.fetch()` takes
 * the context data by value rather than as a callback.  Carry request-level
 * state here, and look anything session-bound up inside the dispatcher that
 * needs it.
 *
 * It may be synchronous or asynchronous, and it is invoked at most once per
