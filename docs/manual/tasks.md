Background tasks
================

*This API is available since Fedify 2.4.0.*

Fedify already processes outgoing and incoming activities on background
workers through its [message queue](./mq.md).  The custom background task API
generalizes the same pattern—enqueue work, return immediately, process the
payload on a separate worker—to arbitrary application-defined jobs: sending
digest e-mails, rebuilding timelines, fetching link previews, and so on.

A task is *defined* once on the `Federation` (or `FederationBuilder`) object
with `~TaskRegistry.defineTask()`, and *dispatched* from any `Context` with
`~Context.enqueueTask()`.  The payload is validated, serialized by Fedify,
delivered through a message queue, and handed—decoded and re-validated—to the
task's handler on a worker.


Defining a task
---------------

`~TaskRegistry.defineTask()` registers a named task and returns a handle that
`~Context.enqueueTask()` consumes.  Every task requires a `schema`, a
[Standard Schema] (implemented by [Zod], [Valibot], [ArkType], and friends)
that validates the payload; the payload type is inferred from it, so handlers
and call sites are fully typed without manual type annotations:

~~~~ typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const sendDigest = federation.defineTask("sendDigest", {
  schema: z.object({
    userId: z.string(),
    since: z.date(),
  }),
  handler: async (ctx, data) => {
    // data is typed as { userId: string; since: Date }
    const digest = await buildDigest(data.userId, data.since);
    await sendEmail(data.userId, digest);
  },
});
~~~~

Task names must be unique within a federation; defining the same name twice
throws a `TypeError`.

Payload handling
----------------

Task payloads cross a message queue, so they are serialized on enqueue and
deserialized on dispatch.  Fedify owns this codec—applications never encode
payloads themselves.  The codec is built on [devalue], which means payloads
are not limited to JSON: `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, `URL`, `RegExp`, `bigint`,
typed arrays, `Temporal` values (e.g., `Temporal.Instant`,
`Temporal.Duration`), circular references, and repeated references all
round-trip faithfully.

Activity Vocabulary objects (`Note`, `Create`, `Person`, `Link`, and so on)
are also supported as payload values.  Each vocabulary object is bridged
through expanded JSON-LD on the wire and comes back as a real instance, so
the handler can call its methods and getters as usual:

~~~~ typescript
import { Note } from "@fedify/vocab";
import { z } from "zod";

const indexNote = federation.defineTask("indexNote", {
  schema: z.object({
    note: z.instanceof(Note),  // an opaque instanceof leaf
    indexedAt: z.date(),
  }),
  handler: async (ctx, data) => {
    await searchIndex.add(data.note.id?.href, data.note.content?.toString());
  },
});
~~~~

The schema validates the *envelope* of the payload; vocabulary objects are
opaque `instanceof` leaves (e.g., `z.instanceof(Note)`), so no enormous
schema is needed.

Validation runs twice: once at enqueue time, so a caller passing a wrong
shape fails fast at the call site, and once at dequeue time, which protects
against *schema drift*—a durable queue can hand a new deployment a payload
that an older deployment enqueued.  A payload that fails dequeue-time
validation (or cannot be decoded at all) is dropped with an error log rather
than retried, because retrying cannot make it valid.

Because the same schema validates on both sides of the queue, its validation
must be *idempotent*: the validated output must itself be a valid input.
Transforming schemas (e.g., Zod's `.transform()`) whose output differs in
shape from their input are not supported—the payload type is inferred as the
schema's *output*, so the call site already fails validation at enqueue time.

Dispatching tasks
-----------------

`~Context.enqueueTask()` validates the payload, serializes it, and enqueues
it.  It returns as soon as the message is accepted by the queue:

~~~~ typescript
await ctx.enqueueTask(sendDigest, {
  userId: "alice",
  since: new Date("2026-06-01T00:00:00Z"),
});
~~~~

Passing a payload that does not match the task's schema is a compile-time
type error, and—for shapes the type system cannot catch—a runtime
`TypeError` at the call site.

`~Context.enqueueTaskMany()` enqueues multiple payloads at once, using the
queue's bulk `~MessageQueue.enqueueMany()` operation when the backend
supports it and falling back to parallel single enqueues otherwise:

~~~~ typescript
await ctx.enqueueTaskMany(sendDigest, users.map((u) => ({
  userId: u.id,
  since: u.lastDigestAt,
})));
~~~~

Both methods accept options:

`delay`
:   A `Temporal.DurationLike` to postpone processing, e.g.,
    `{ minutes: 30 }`.

`orderingKey`
:   Tasks with the same ordering key are processed sequentially (one at
    a time), like the same option on the message queue layer.

`deduplicationKey`
:   Requests at-most-once enqueue for tasks that share the key; see
    [Deduplication](#deduplication) below.

~~~~ typescript
await ctx.enqueueTask(sendDigest, payload, {
  delay: { minutes: 30 },
  orderingKey: `digest:${payload.userId}`,
});
~~~~


Retry and error handling
------------------------

When a handler throws, Fedify consults the retry policy and re-enqueues the
message with an incremented attempt counter.  The policy is resolved in this
order:

1.  The task's own `retryPolicy` passed to `~TaskRegistry.defineTask()`.
2.  The federation-wide `~FederationOptions.taskRetryPolicy`.
3.  The default: exponential backoff with a maximum of 10 attempts.

When the queue backend reports `~MessageQueue.nativeRetrial`, Fedify rethrows
the error instead and lets the backend drive retries.

A task can also register an `onError` callback, which is invoked with the
error and the decoded payload before a retry is scheduled—useful for
reporting or compensating actions:

~~~~ typescript
const sendDigest = federation.defineTask("sendDigest", {
  schema: digestSchema,
  handler: async (ctx, data) => {
    await sendEmail(data.userId, await buildDigest(data.userId, data.since));
  },
  retryPolicy: createExponentialBackoffPolicy({ maxAttempts: 3 }),
  onError: async (ctx, error, data) => {
    await reportFailure("sendDigest", data.userId, error);
  },
});
~~~~

Two failure cases are *dropped without retry*, because retrying cannot help:
a message whose `taskName` has no registered handler (logged as a warning),
and a payload that cannot be decoded or fails dequeue-time validation
(logged as an error).


Queue routing and isolation
---------------------------

By default tasks share the outbox queue, so no extra configuration is needed
beyond a `queue` on `createFederation()`.  For heavier workloads, tasks can
be isolated at two levels.

A dedicated task queue, separate from activity delivery, is configured with
the `~FederationQueueOptions.task` slot:

~~~~ typescript
const federation = createFederation<void>({
  // ...
  queue: {
    inbox: new PostgresMessageQueue(sql, { channel: "inbox" }),
    outbox: new PostgresMessageQueue(sql, { channel: "outbox" }),
    task: new PostgresMessageQueue(sql, { channel: "task" }),  // [!code highlight]
  },
});
~~~~

A single task can also carry its own queue, which takes precedence over
everything else:

~~~~ typescript
const transcodeVideo = federation.defineTask("transcodeVideo", {
  schema: transcodeSchema,
  handler: transcodeHandler,
  queue: new PostgresMessageQueue(sql, { channel: "transcode" }),
});
~~~~

Workers for dedicated per-task queues are registered when the queue
machinery starts, so define every task before `~Federation.startQueue()`
is called (or, without `~FederationOptions.manuallyStartQueue`, before the
first request is handled); a per-task queue defined later may not get
a worker until the queue machinery is next started.

The queue for a task is resolved in order: the per-task `queue`, then the
federation's `task` queue, then the outbox queue.  Deployments that must
*not* silently share the outbox queue can opt out of the last step with
`~FederationOptions.taskQueueResolution`:

~~~~ typescript
const federation = createFederation<void>({
  // ...
  taskQueueResolution: "strict",  // no outbox fallback  // [!code highlight]
});
~~~~

Under `"strict"` resolution, enqueuing a task that has no queue throws
a `TypeError` instead of falling back.

On the worker side, `~Federation.startQueue()` accepts `"task"` in its
`queue` option, so a dedicated worker process can consume only tasks:

~~~~ typescript
await federation.startQueue(contextData, { queue: "task" });
~~~~

A task that falls back to the outbox queue needs no dedicated worker; the
outbox worker dispatches every message by its type regardless of which queue
delivered it.

> Task payloads cross durable queue storage, so treat the queue backend and

> queue and set `taskQueueResolution: "strict"`.


Deduplication
-------------

A task often needs *at-most-once-per-key* enqueue: a digest mailer must not
send twice when a request is retried, and a cleanup job should coalesce
duplicate triggers.  Passing a `deduplicationKey` requests this—while the
first enqueue is still within the deduplication window, a second enqueue
with the same key is dropped.  Whether that drop actually happens depends
on the queue and key–value store, as the fallback rules below decide:

~~~~ typescript
await ctx.enqueueTask(sendDigest, payload, {
  deduplicationKey: `digest:${payload.userId}`,  // [!code highlight]
});
~~~~

How the key is resolved depends on the queue and the key–value store:

1.  *Native backend.*  When the task's queue declares
    `~MessageQueue.nativeDeduplication`, Fedify forwards the key in the
    message queue's `~MessageQueueEnqueueOptions.deduplicationKey` and the
    backend owns the check.  Fedify does not touch the key–value store.

2.  *Key–value fallback.*  Otherwise, if the configured `KvStore` exposes
    the optional compare-and-swap (`~KvStore.cas`) primitive, Fedify records
    the key under a dedicated `taskDeduplication` prefix with a TTL and skips
    the enqueue while a marker is present.  The TTL defaults to one hour and is
    configurable with `~FederationOptions.taskDeduplicationTtl`:

    ~~~~ typescript
    const federation = createFederation<void>({
      // ...
      taskDeduplicationTtl: { minutes: 10 },  // [!code highlight]
    });
    ~~~~

3.  *No conditional write.*  When neither applies—no native deduplication and
    a key–value store without `~KvStore.cas`—the behavior is governed by
    `~FederationOptions.taskDeduplicationFallback`.  `"open"` (the default)
    lets the enqueue proceed without deduplication after a debug-level log;
    `"closed"` throws a `TypeError` before enqueuing:

    ~~~~ typescript
    const federation = createFederation<void>({
      // ...
      taskDeduplicationFallback: "closed",  // [!code highlight]
    });
    ~~~~

Among the first-party adapters, the in-memory, Deno KV, SQLite, MySQL,
PostgreSQL, and Redis key–value stores implement `~KvStore.cas`; Cloudflare
Workers KV does not, so those deployments take the
`taskDeduplicationFallback` branch until per-adapter follow-ups add it.

For `~Context.enqueueTaskMany()`, a single `deduplicationKey` applies to the
whole batch: the batch enqueues as a unit or is skipped as a unit, never
partially.  Per-item deduplication means calling `~Context.enqueueTask()` in
a loop, each with its own key.  Deduplicating a multi-item batch requires the
queue to implement `~MessageQueue.enqueueMany()` so the batch enqueues
atomically—whether the check is native or the key–value fallback.  Fanning the
key out across separate `~MessageQueue.enqueue()` calls cannot enqueue a whole
batch as one unit: a native per-message key cannot cover it, and a key–value
marker could not be rolled back cleanly if only some of the fanned-out enqueues
failed.  So when deduplication is actually applied—a native queue, or a
key–value store with `~KvStore.cas`—Fedify rejects a multi-item batch with a
`deduplicationKey` on a queue without `~MessageQueue.enqueueMany()` instead of
risking duplicates.  Under the `"open"` fallback (no native deduplication and no
`cas`), no marker is taken, so the batch simply fans out without deduplication.
The same rejection applies when a queue implements `enqueueMany()` by sending
messages separately and declares `atomicEnqueueMany: false`.

This applies through `ParallelMessageQueue` as well: wrapping a queue that
lacks an atomic `~MessageQueue.enqueueMany()` does not make batch enqueue
atomic, so a deduplicated multi-item batch on such a wrapper is likewise
rejected rather than collapsed onto one message.

Observability
-------------

*Task-specific telemetry is available since Fedify 2.4.0.*

Each task the worker dequeues runs inside a `fedify.task` [OpenTelemetry] span
(a *consumer* span, since tasks are not part of ActivityPub it is namespaced
under `fedify.` rather than `activitypub.`).  The span inherits the trace
context captured at the enqueue site, so a task's processing chains to the
request or job that enqueued it—and every retry attempt chains to the same
parent.  The span carries:

 -  `fedify.task.name` — the registered task name.
 -  `fedify.task.attempt` — the zero-based attempt number; a retry re-enqueue
    increments it.
 -  `fedify.task.failure_reason` — set only on a terminal failure, one of the
    five bounded values below.

On a terminal failure the span's status is also set to `ERROR`, so trace-based
error views surface dropped and given-up tasks together with their
`fedify.task.failure_reason`.  A worker shutdown is the one exception: an
`aborted` attempt leaves the status unset, since an interruption is not a task
failure.

Tasks also reuse the `fedify.queue.task.*` metric family (`enqueued`,
`started`, `completed`, `failed`, `duration`, `in_flight`) that the inbox,
outbox, and fanout workers already report.  Across these measurements
`fedify.queue.role` is `task` and `fedify.task.name` names the task; the
process-local `in_flight` UpDownCounter omits `fedify.task.name` so its
increments and decrements pair up cleanly.  `fedify.queue.task.enqueued` is
recorded at the enqueue site—both the initial enqueue and a retry
re-enqueue—whereas `started`, `completed`, `failed`, and `duration` are
recorded during the worker run.
`fedify.queue.backend` reflects the queue actually used after routing—so a task
that falls back to the `outboxQueue` (see
[Routing](#queue-routing-and-isolation)) is labeled with the outbox queue's
backend, not a task queue's.  A failed outcome
also carries `fedify.task.failure_reason` on `fedify.queue.task.failed` and
`fedify.queue.task.duration`.

The `fedify.task.failure_reason` attribute takes one of five bounded values,
mapping to the worker's dispatch and retry-scheduling decision points:

| Value             | Meaning                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `deserialization` | The wire payload could not be deserialized.        |
| `validation`      | The deserialized payload failed schema validation. |
| `unknown_task`    | The task name has no registered handler.           |
| `handler`         | The registered handler threw.                      |
| `retry_enqueue`   | A retry was scheduled, but re-enqueuing it failed. |

The first three are *drops*: the payload cannot succeed by retrying, so the
worker acknowledges the message and does not re-enqueue it.  Telemetry still
records these as a failed outcome with the matching reason, while the queue is
left drained—so a drop is observable without being retried.  A `handler`
failure follows the configured retry policy (see
[Retries](#retry-and-error-handling)): an attempt folded into a scheduled
retry records a `completed` outcome, and only the terminal give-up records
`failed` with the `handler` reason.  If a retry *is* scheduled but re-enqueuing
the retry message to the queue backend fails, the worker instead records
`failed` with the `retry_enqueue` reason and re-throws (so the message is
nacked, not dropped), preserving the original handler error as the thrown
error's cause.  A worker shutdown is never counted as a
failure: an interrupted attempt carries no `fedify.task.failure_reason`—it is
recorded as an `aborted` outcome when the abort propagates (on a
`nativeRetrial` queue) or when the retry policy declines another attempt, and
otherwise folded into a scheduled retry like any handler error.

The bounded value set keeps metric cardinality finite: a metric's task name is
a registered, known-at-startup value, never derived from message content—an
`unknown_task` drop carries a wire-supplied name, so that name is kept off the
metrics (it still appears on the span, which does not aggregate into time
series).

For example, grouping `fedify.queue.task.failed` by
`fedify.task.failure_reason` separates schema drift
(`deserialization`/`validation` drops) from `handler` give-ups. Or, filtering
`fedify.queue.task.enqueued` for `fedify.queue.task.attempt > 0` (or reading
`fedify.task.attempt` on the `fedify.task` span) surfaces retry re-enqueues
before they become give-ups.

See the [OpenTelemetry](./opentelemetry.md) manual for the full span,
attribute, and metric reference.

Limitations
-----------

The current API intentionally ships without cron-style periodic scheduling,
result backends, and per-task priority.  Some of these are planned as
follow-ups; see the [tracking issue].
