  In this tutorial, we will build a small Pixelfed-style federated image
  sharing service on top of Nuxt and Fedify, an ActivityPub server framework.
  The focus is on learning Fedify rather than Nuxt, and the result will
  federate with Mastodon, Pixelfed, and any other ActivityPub software.
---

Creating a federated image sharing service
==========================================

In this tutorial we will build a small federated image sharing service,
similar to [Pixelfed] or, in a way, to [Instagram] with the locks blown off,
using [Nuxt] on the client and server side and [Fedify] for everything
ActivityPub.  The goal is to learn Fedify rather than Nuxt, but a brief tour
of Nuxt's building blocks is included so that a reader with only vanilla
JavaScript experience can follow along.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please feel free to join
our [Matrix chat space] or [GitHub Discussions].

Target audience
---------------

This tutorial is aimed at web developers who want to learn Fedify and try
their hand at building federated software.

We assume you have some experience building small web applications with HTML
and JavaScript, and that you are comfortable with a terminal.  You do *not*
need to know TypeScript, Vue, Nuxt, SQL, ActivityPub, or Fedify.  We will teach
just enough of each along the way.

You don't need experience creating ActivityPub software, but we do assume
that you have used at least one fediverse service, like [Mastodon], [Pixelfed],
or [Misskey], so you have a feel for what we are trying to build.

If you have already worked through the [*Creating your own federated
microblog*](./microblog.md) tutorial, you will find many of the concepts
familiar.  This tutorial treads similar ground but swaps Hono and JSX for
Nuxt and Vue, and focuses on image posts instead of text posts.  The two
tutorials are designed to complement each other rather than stack on top,
so you can read them in either order.

Goals
-----

We will end up with a single-user image sharing service that can talk to the
rest of the fediverse via ActivityPub.  Its features are:

 -  Only one account can be created on the instance.
 -  Other accounts in the fediverse can follow the local user.
 -  Followers can unfollow the local user.
 -  The user can view their list of followers.
 -  The user can upload image posts with captions.
 -  Posts published by the user fan out to their followers' timelines.
 -  The user can follow other accounts in the fediverse.
 -  The user can view the accounts they are following.
 -  The user sees a chronological home timeline of posts from accounts they
    follow.
 -  The user can like posts, and likes coming from remote actors are recorded.
 -  The user can leave comments on posts, and replies coming from remote
    actors are recorded.

To keep the tutorial focused, we impose these constraints:

 -  Each post has exactly one image; no carousels.
 -  Account profiles (bio, profile picture) cannot be edited.
 -  Posts cannot be edited or deleted once published.
 -  No boosts (reposts), no direct messages, no search.
 -  No pagination.
 -  No authentication: whoever opens the browser first owns the instance.

You are encouraged to add any of these features yourself after finishing the
tutorial.  The closing chapter lists a few natural extensions as a starting
point.

The full source code is available in the [GitHub repository].  Each chapter
that touches the example app lands as its own commit, with a small number of
follow-up commits at the tip that fix issues spotted during the end-to-end
rehearsal.  Reading the log from the bottom up still walks through the chapters
in order; the latest tip is the canonical end state.

Setting up the development environment
--------------------------------------

### Installing Node.js

Fedify supports three JavaScript runtimes: [Deno], [Bun], and [Node.js].
Among the three, Node.js is the most widely used, and Nuxt targets Node.js
by default, so that is what we will use.

> [!TIP]
> A JavaScript runtime is a platform that executes JavaScript code outside
> a web browser.  Node.js is the most widely used one for server applications
> and command-line tools.  Nuxt runs on top of Node.js (it also runs on Bun
> and Deno, but Node.js gives the smoothest experience).

To use Fedify 2.2.0 and Nuxt 4, you need Node.js 22.0.0 or higher.  There
are [various installation methods]; pick the one that suits your system.

Once Node.js is installed, the `node` and `npm` commands become available:

~~~~ sh
node --version
npm --version
~~~~

[Deno]: https://deno.com/
[Bun]: https://bun.sh/
[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/
[various installation methods]: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager

### Installing the `fedify` command

To scaffold a Fedify project, install the [`fedify`](../cli.md) command on
your system.  There are [several installation methods](../cli.md#installation),
but using `npm` is the simplest:

~~~~ sh
npm install -g @fedify/cli
~~~~

After installation, check the version:

~~~~ sh
fedify --version
~~~~

Make sure the version is 2.2.0 or higher; older versions do not ship the
Nuxt integration we rely on.

### `fedify init` to scaffold the project

Pick a directory where you want to work.  We will call ours
*content-sharing*.  Then run
[`fedify init`](../cli.md#fedify-init-initializing-a-fedify-project) with four
non-interactive options so the command does not ask you any questions:

~~~~ sh
fedify init -w nuxt -p npm -k in-memory -m in-process content-sharing
~~~~

The flags tell `fedify init` to use:

`-w nuxt`
:   Nuxt as the web framework.

`-p npm`
:   Npm as the package manager.

`-k in-memory`
:   An in-memory [key&ndash;value store](../manual/kv.md) for Fedify.  This is
    perfect for development; once you deploy, you would swap it for Redis or
    a relational database.

`-m in-process`
:   An in-process [message queue](../manual/mq.md) for Fedify.  The same
    reasoning applies: fine for development, swap for Redis or RabbitMQ in
    production.

After a short install you will see something like this printed at the end:

~~~~ console
✨ Nuxt project has been created with the minimal template.

╭── 👉 Next steps ───╮
│                    │
│   › npm run dev    │
│                    │
╰────────────────────╯

  To start the server, run the following command:

`npm run dev`

Then, try to look up an actor from your server:

`fedify lookup http://localhost:3000/users/john`

      Start by editing the server/federation.ts file to define your federation!
~~~~

Move into the directory and take a look at what got generated:

~~~~ sh
cd content-sharing
ls -a
~~~~

The most interesting files and directories are:

 -  *app/*: the Vue side of the app.
     -  *app.vue*: the root Vue component that Nuxt renders on every page.
        Right now it shows a `<NuxtWelcome />` component, which is the page
        you will see in a moment.
 -  *public/*: static assets served as-is (favicon, *robots.txt*, and any
    uploaded images we will add later).
 -  *server/*: code that runs on the server only.
     -  *federation.ts*: the Fedify federation object.  This is where actors,
        inbox listeners, and object dispatchers are registered.  Most of our
        work will land here.
     -  *logging.ts*: [LogTape] configuration used by Fedify.  The default
        export is the configuration promise; we never call into this file
        directly.
     -  *plugins/logging.ts*: a [Nitro server plugin] that awaits the
        configuration promise on startup so Fedify's logs are alive before
        any request lands.
 -  *nuxt.config.ts*: Nuxt's configuration file; already has `@fedify/nuxt`
    wired up as a module.
 -  *package.json*: npm metadata and dependencies.
 -  *.oxfmtrc.json*: [Oxfmt] formatter configuration.
 -  *.oxlintrc.json*: [Oxlint] configuration, including Fedify lint rules.
 -  *tsconfig.json*: TypeScript compiler references to the generated Nuxt
    type files.

We are using TypeScript, so most source files end in *.ts* (for pure
TypeScript) or *.vue* (for Vue single-file components that may contain
TypeScript in their `<script>` blocks).

### Running the dev server for the first time

Let's make sure the scaffolded project boots:

~~~~ sh
npm run dev
~~~~

Keep this terminal open; the server will keep running until you stop it with
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>:

~~~~ console
●  Nuxt 4.4.2 (with Nitro 2.13.3, Vite 7.3.2 and Vue 3.5.33)

  ➜ Local:    http://localhost:3000/
  ➜ Network:  use --host to expose
~~~~

Open <http://localhost:3000/> in a browser.  You should see Nuxt's default
welcome page:

![Nuxt's welcome page at http://localhost:3000/ after running `npm run dev`
for the first time.](./content-sharing/nuxt-welcome-page.png)

We will replace this page with our own in the next chapter.  But first,
let's prove that Fedify is actually serving federation routes on the same
server.  In a *new terminal* (keep `npm run dev` running in the first
one), run:

~~~~ sh
fedify lookup http://localhost:3000/users/alice
~~~~

You should see output like this:

~~~~ console
✔ Fetched object: http://localhost:3000/users/alice
Person {
  id: URL 'http://localhost:3000/users/alice',
  name: 'alice',
  preferredUsername: 'alice'
}
✔ Successfully fetched the object.
~~~~

That tells us a few important things at once:

 -  The same HTTP server that rendered the welcome page at */* also serves
    an ActivityPub `Person` object at */users/alice*.  `@fedify/nuxt` is
    doing content negotiation for us: browsers get HTML; ActivityPub clients
    (which send `Accept: application/activity+json`) get JSON-LD.
 -  The `alice` we asked for was *not* predefined anywhere.  The scaffolded
    *server/federation.ts* contains an actor dispatcher that happily turns
    any identifier into a stub `Person`.  We will tighten this up later so
    only the real local user has an actor.

> [!TIP]
> [`fedify lookup`](../cli.md#fedify-lookup-looking-up-an-activitypub-object)
> queries ActivityPub objects from the command line.  It is equivalent to
> pasting the URI into Mastodon's search box, except it works against your
> local server too.
>
> If you prefer `curl`, you can also query the actor directly (note the
> <code>Accept</code> header):
>
> ~~~~ sh
> curl -H "Accept: application/activity+json" http://localhost:3000/users/alice
> ~~~~
>
> The response is compact JSON, so pipe it through `jq` if you have it
> installed for easier reading.

### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code] may not be your favorite editor, but we recommend it
while following this tutorial.  We are about to write a lot of TypeScript
and Vue, and VS Code is currently the smoothest editor for both.  The
scaffolded project even ships with a *.vscode/* directory that recommends
the right extensions (Oxc for formatting and linting, Volar for Vue).

> [!WARNING]
> Don't confuse Visual Studio Code with Visual Studio.  The two share a
> brand name and nothing else.

After [installing Visual Studio Code], open the project folder via
*File* → *Open Folder…*.  If you see a popup asking <q>Do you want to
install the recommended extensions?</q>, click *Install*.

> [!TIP]
> Emacs and Vim users: we are not here to talk you out of your editor, but
> please do set up TypeScript LSP and the Volar Vue language server.  The
> difference in productivity when editing large Vue components is
> substantial.

Prerequisites
-------------

### TypeScript in a nutshell

Before we dive in, let's glance at TypeScript.  If you already know it,
skip this section.

TypeScript is JavaScript plus static type checking.  The syntax is almost
identical, except you can annotate variables and function parameters with
types by writing a colon followed by the type:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
let username: string;
~~~~

If you try to assign a value of a different type, the editor will show a
red squiggle *before you even run it*:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
// @errors: 2322
let username: string;
// ---cut-before---
username = 123;
~~~~

The single most common type error you will see is the `null` possibility
error.  For example, if a function can return either a `string` or `null`,
TypeScript forces you to handle both:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
function loadCaption(): string | null { return ""; }
// ---cut-before---
const caption: string | null = loadCaption();
~~~~

Trying to call a string method on this value fails:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
// @errors: 18047
function loadCaption(): string | null { return ""; }
const caption: string | null = loadCaption();
// ---cut-before---
const firstChar = caption.charAt(0);
~~~~

TypeScript is telling you that `caption` might be `null`, and
`null.charAt(0)` would blow up.  The fix is to handle the `null` branch
explicitly:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
function loadCaption(): string | null { return ""; }
const caption: string | null = loadCaption();
// ---cut-before---
const firstChar = caption === null ? "" : caption.charAt(0);
~~~~

This catches bugs you would otherwise find only at runtime.  Another
incidental benefit is auto-completion: type `caption.` in your editor and
you will see every method `string` has.  Fedify ships hand-written types
for every ActivityPub object, so you get the same experience for actors,
activities, and objects.

> [!TIP]
> For a deeper tour of TypeScript, *[The TypeScript Handbook]* takes about
> 30 minutes to read.

[The TypeScript Handbook]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html

### Vue and Nuxt in a nutshell

[Vue] is a component-based UI framework.  A component is a *.vue* file with
three optional blocks: `<script>` for JavaScript or TypeScript, `<template>`
for HTML, and `<style>` for CSS.  For example:

~~~~ vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const count = ref(0);
</script>

<template>
  <button type="button" @click="count++">
    Clicked {{ count }} times
  </button>
</template>
~~~~

A few things are worth noting:

 -  `<script setup>` lets you expose variables from the script block to the
    template just by declaring them.
 -  `ref(0)` creates a reactive value.  When `count` changes, any template
    using `{{ count }}` re-renders.
 -  `@click="count++"` attaches a click listener.

[Nuxt] is a meta-framework built on top of Vue.  It adds:

 -  *File-based routing*.  A Vue file at *app/pages/index.vue* becomes the
    route */*, and a file named *\[username].vue* inside
    *app/pages/users/* becomes */users/:username*.
 -  *Server routes*.  A TypeScript file at *server/api/posts.ts* becomes an
    HTTP endpoint at */api/posts*.
 -  *Built-in TypeScript, Vite-based hot reloading, SSR, and a modules
    system.*  [`@fedify/nuxt`][fedify-nuxt] is one such module.

Think of Nuxt as Vue with Next.js-style conveniences bolted on.  In this
tutorial, we will write Vue components for HTML views and plain TypeScript
for server-side logic.  Whenever the two need to talk, we will define a
small JSON API in *server/api/*.

[Vue]: https://vuejs.org/
[fedify-nuxt]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fedify/nuxt

### What is ActivityPub, roughly?

ActivityPub is a decentralized social networking protocol.  Every user has
an *actor* (usually of type `Person`), which is just a JSON-LD object
hosted at a stable URL.  Actors can send each other *activities* (like
`Follow`, `Create`, `Like`, `Announce`, `Delete`) by POSTing them to the
recipient's *inbox* URL.  Each actor also advertises a *followers*
collection, an *outbox*, a few cryptographic keys, and so on.

You do not need to know any of this in detail to follow the tutorial.
Fedify gives you typed helpers for every activity and object, so you can
think in terms like “when someone follows alice, insert a row in the
`followers` table” instead of “parse JSON-LD, verify HTTP signatures,
dereference the actor”.  Whenever we introduce a new activity or property,
we will explain what it means.


A minimal app shell
-------------------

Before we get into federation work, let's replace Nuxt's placeholder welcome
page with a tiny layout that looks like a real image sharing site.  We will
keep it intentionally plain so the CSS stays out of the way for the rest of
the tutorial.

We are calling our instance *PxShare* throughout the tutorial.  It is a
made-up name; feel free to pick your own.

### Installing unocss

We will use [UnoCSS] for styling.  UnoCSS is a tiny utility-first CSS
engine; you write classes like `flex`, `rounded-full`, `text-brand`, and
it generates just enough CSS to cover what you used.  This keeps our
stylesheets short and lets later chapters paste a few class names instead
of writing real CSS.

Install UnoCSS as a Nuxt module, its Wind3 preset (utility set), and a
CSS reset:

~~~~ sh
npm install -D unocss @unocss/nuxt @unocss/preset-wind3 @unocss/reset
~~~~

[UnoCSS]: https://unocss.dev/

### Configuring Nuxt and unocss

Add UnoCSS to the Nuxt module list and point Nuxt at a stylesheet we will
create in a moment.  Replace *nuxt.config.ts* with:

~~~~ typescript [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@fedify/nuxt", "@unocss/nuxt"],
  fedify: { federationModule: "#server/federation" },
  ssr: true,
  css: ["~/assets/styles.css"],
});
~~~~

Then create *uno.config.ts* at the project root to configure the utility
set and add one custom color for our brand accent:

~~~~ typescript [uno.config.ts]
import { defineConfig, presetWind3 } from "unocss";

export default defineConfig({
  presets: [presetWind3()],
  theme: {
    colors: {
      brand: {
        DEFAULT: "#e85a9b",
        dark: "#c43f7d",
      },
    },
  },
});
~~~~

The `brand` color is what will power the pink accent on buttons and the
logo; `brand-dark` is a slightly darker variant we will use for hover
states.

Create *app/assets/styles.css* with a CSS reset and one or two global
styles:

~~~~ css [app/assets/styles.css]
@import "@unocss/reset/tailwind.css";

html,
body,
#__nuxt {
  height: 100%;
}

body {
  font-family:
    system-ui,
    -apple-system,
    "Segoe UI",
    sans-serif;
  background: #fafafa;
  color: #262626;
}
~~~~

### The root layout

Replace *app/app.vue* with a two-row layout: a sticky top navbar, a main
area that holds whatever page we are on, and a small footer.  The
`<NuxtPage />` component is where Nuxt injects the page matched by the
current URL.

~~~~ vue [app/app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const siteName = "PxShare";
</script>

<template>
  <div class="min-h-screen flex flex-col">
    <header
      class="sticky top-0 z-10 bg-white border-b border-gray-200 px-4 py-3 flex items-center justify-between"
    >
      <NuxtLink to="/" class="text-xl font-bold text-brand tracking-tight">
        {{ siteName }}
      </NuxtLink>
      <nav class="flex items-center gap-4 text-sm">
        <NuxtLink
          to="/compose"
          class="px-3 py-1.5 bg-brand text-white rounded-full hover:bg-brand-dark"
        >
          Compose
        </NuxtLink>
      </nav>
    </header>
    <main class="flex-1 max-w-2xl w-full mx-auto px-4 py-6">
      <NuxtPage />
    </main>
    <footer class="py-6 text-center text-xs text-gray-400">
      Built with Fedify and Nuxt
    </footer>
  </div>
</template>
~~~~

> [!TIP]
> Three Nuxt things to notice here:
>
>  -  `<NuxtLink to="/">` is Nuxt's client-side navigation link.  It
>     renders as an `<a>` element, but clicks update the URL without a
>     full page reload.
>  -  `<NuxtPage />` is the slot where the currently matched page
>     component renders.  If we did not include it, our pages would
>     never show.
>  -  `<script setup lang="ts">` is Vue's *single-file component script
>     setup* syntax.  Top-level bindings (like `siteName`) are
>     automatically available in the template.

### The home page

Create *app/pages/index.vue* for the `/` route:

~~~~ vue [app/pages/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
useHead({ title: "PxShare" });
</script>

<template>
  <section class="text-center py-16">
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Welcome to PxShare</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-500">A tiny federated image sharing service.</p>
  </section>
</template>
~~~~

`useHead({ title: "PxShare" })` sets the browser tab title.  We will use
the same helper later to set per-page titles.

### Checking the result

Save every file.  If `npm run dev` is still running from the previous
chapter, Nuxt picks up the changes automatically, though it restarts once
because *nuxt.config.ts* changed.  Otherwise, run it again:

~~~~ sh
npm run dev
~~~~

> [!TIP]
> Adding a brand-new file under *app/pages/* sometimes makes Nuxt's
> HMR briefly serve a 404 for the new route while the route map
> reloads.  If that happens, stop the dev server with
> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> and run `npm run dev` again; a clean
> start always picks the new page up.  The same applies later when
> we add the rest of the routes.

Open <http://localhost:3000/> and you should see the new shell:

![The PxShare home page: a pink brand name on the left, a Compose button
on the right, and a simple welcome message in the
middle.](./content-sharing/app-shell-home.png)

Nothing federated yet, but the skeleton is ready for us to fill in.  The
ActivityPub actor from the previous chapter still works:

~~~~ sh
fedify lookup http://localhost:3000/users/alice
~~~~

Content negotiation means the same URL serves the welcome layout to a
browser and a JSON-LD `Person` object to ActivityPub clients.  Chapter 6
covers this in detail.


Setting up the database
-----------------------

Fediverse software needs persistent state: who the local user is, who
follows them, what they have posted, what they have liked.  We will use
[SQLite] because it is a single file with no server to run, and we will
talk to it through [Drizzle ORM] so the schema is a TypeScript file and
the queries are typed.

> [!TIP]
> If you prefer raw SQL, Drizzle does not stand in the way: the same
> library exposes a ``db.run(sql`…`)`` escape hatch.  We stick to the
> typed query builder in this tutorial so you can hover your cursor over
> any database call in your editor and see the columns involved.

[SQLite]: https://sqlite.org/
[Drizzle ORM]: https://orm.drizzle.team/

### Installing the packages

Install Drizzle, the better-sqlite3 driver, Drizzle's CLI (used only at
dev time to push schema changes), and the TypeScript type
declarations for better-sqlite3:

~~~~ sh
npm install better-sqlite3 drizzle-orm
npm install -D drizzle-kit @types/better-sqlite3
~~~~

### The schema

Create *server/db/schema.ts* with just an empty module marker.  Later
chapters will fill it in; keeping the file present lets us import it
from the client right away.

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/db/schema.ts]
// Tables live here.  For now the file is empty; later chapters will fill
// in tables for the local user, followers, posts, comments, and likes.

export {};
~~~~

> [!NOTE]
> The `export {}` line makes TypeScript treat this file as a module
> rather than a plain script.  Without it, other files cannot
> `import * as schema from "./schema"`.

### The database connection

Create *server/db/client.ts*, which opens the SQLite file on disk and
wraps it with Drizzle:

~~~~ typescript [server/db/client.ts]
import Database from "better-sqlite3";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3";
import * as schema from "./schema";

const sqlite = new Database("content-sharing.sqlite3");
sqlite.pragma("journal_mode = WAL");
sqlite.pragma("foreign_keys = ON");

export const db = drizzle(sqlite, { schema });
~~~~

Two pragmas are worth knowing:

[`journal_mode = WAL`]
:   Switches SQLite to [write-ahead logging][Write-Ahead Logging], which
    makes concurrent reads and writes much smoother.  You almost always
    want this on for server applications.

[`foreign_keys = ON`]
:   SQLite does not enforce `REFERENCES` constraints unless you ask.
    Turning this on catches cases like “insert a follower row for a
    user that does not exist” as an error at write time.

The exported `db` is what every server route and Fedify handler will
import when it needs to read or write.

[`journal_mode = WAL`]: https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html
[Write-Ahead Logging]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging
[`foreign_keys = ON`]: https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_enable

### The drizzle-kit config

`drizzle-kit` is the command-line tool that turns the TypeScript
schema into actual SQL.  Configure it at the project root as
*drizzle.config.ts*:

~~~~ typescript [drizzle.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";

export default defineConfig({
  schema: "./server/db/schema.ts",
  out: "./server/db/migrations",
  dialect: "sqlite",
  dbCredentials: { url: "content-sharing.sqlite3" },
});
~~~~

Expose two npm scripts that wrap drizzle-kit, so the reader never has
to type the tool's name directly.  Edit *package.json*:

~~~~ json [package.json]
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "nuxt build",
    "dev": "nuxt dev",
    "generate": "nuxt generate",
    "preview": "nuxt preview",
    "postinstall": "nuxt prepare",
    "format": "oxfmt",
    "format:check": "oxfmt --check",
    "lint": "oxlint .",

  }
}
~~~~

`db:push` compares the schema to the live database and applies any
differences.  `db:studio` opens a local web UI for poking at rows,
which is occasionally handy while debugging.

### Creating the database

Run the push command once now:

~~~~ sh
npm run db:push
~~~~

It should print something like:

~~~~ console
[i] No changes detected
~~~~

That is correct: the schema is empty, so there is nothing to create
yet.  The command also creates an empty *content-sharing.sqlite3* file
on disk as a side effect.  From now on, every chapter that edits the
schema will ask you to re-run `npm run db:push`.

### Gitignoring the database file

Add the SQLite file (and its sidecars that WAL mode creates) to
*.gitignore* so your local state does not end up in git:

~~~~ gitignore [.gitignore]
# Local SQLite database
*.sqlite3
*.sqlite3-journal
*.sqlite3-shm
*.sqlite3-wal
~~~~


Account creation
----------------

Our instance hosts exactly one user.  In this chapter we wire up a
first-run signup flow: if no account exists, Nuxt redirects to
*/setup*; once the account is created, the middleware steps aside and
we see the home page.

### The `users` table

Open *server/db/schema.ts* and replace the placeholder with a real
`users` table:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/db/schema.ts]
import { sql } from "drizzle-orm";
import { check, integer, sqliteTable, text } from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

// The single local user of this instance.  The `id = 1` check enforces
// "only one account per instance"; if anyone tries to insert another
// row, SQLite rejects the write.  That same check makes `username`
// trivially unique, so we deliberately do not add `.unique()` on it
// (drizzle-kit re-emits unique indexes on every push against a CHECK-
// constrained table and the second push fails).
export const users = sqliteTable(
  "users",
  {
    id: integer("id").primaryKey({ autoIncrement: false }),
    username: text("username").notNull(),
    name: text("name").notNull(),
    createdAt: text("created_at")
      .notNull()
      .default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`),
  },
  (t) => [check("users_single_user", sql`${t.id} = 1`)],
);

export type User = typeof users.$inferSelect;
~~~~

A few SQL-shaped details worth explaining:

 -  `CHECK (id = 1)` is a table-level constraint that rejects any row
    whose `id` is not 1.  Since the column is also the primary key, it
    is unique, so the combination means “at most one row, and its id is
    always 1”.  This is how we keep the instance single-user at the
    storage layer.
 -  `username` is `NOT NULL`.  A user with no username makes no sense
    in a federated app.  We do not add `UNIQUE` here because the
    `CHECK (id = 1)` constraint already limits the table to a single
    row, which makes `username` trivially unique.
 -  `created_at` gets `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, meaning SQLite fills
    it in automatically when we `INSERT` without supplying it.
 -  `User = typeof users.$inferSelect` gives us the TypeScript type
    corresponding to a row read from this table.  We will import `User`
    in many places and never have to maintain the shape by hand.

Apply the schema to the database:

~~~~ sh
npm run db:push
~~~~

### A helper for reading the local user

Almost every server route needs to know “is anyone registered?” or
“who is the local user?”.  Rather than repeat the query, put it in a
utility module:

~~~~ typescript [server/utils/users.ts]
import { db } from "../db/client";
import { users } from "../db/schema";

export async function getLocalUser() {
  return (await db.select().from(users).limit(1).all())[0] ?? null;
}
~~~~

Drizzle's `db.select().from(users).limit(1).all()` builds the SQL
`SELECT * FROM "users" LIMIT 1` for us; the `[0] ?? null` pattern turns
an empty result into `null` so callers can write
`if (user === null) …`.

### The signup endpoint

Create *server/api/signup.post.ts*.  The `.post.ts` suffix tells Nuxt
to only match `POST` requests to */api/signup*.

~~~~ typescript [server/api/signup.post.ts]
import { createError, defineEventHandler, readBody } from "h3";
import { db } from "../db/client";
import { users } from "../db/schema";
import { getLocalUser } from "../utils/users";

const USERNAME_PATTERN = /^[a-z0-9_]+$/;

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const existing = await getLocalUser();
  if (existing !== null) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 409,
      statusMessage: "Account already exists on this instance.",
    });
  }

  const body = await readBody<{ username?: unknown; name?: unknown }>(event);
  const username =
    typeof body.username === "string" ? body.username.trim().toLowerCase() : "";
  const name = typeof body.name === "string" ? body.name.trim() : "";

  if (username === "" || !USERNAME_PATTERN.test(username)) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 400,
      statusMessage:
        "Username must be non-empty and use only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores.",
    });
  }
  if (name === "") {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 400,
      statusMessage: "Display name must not be empty.",
    });
  }

  await db.insert(users).values({ id: 1, username, name });

  return { ok: true };
});
~~~~

> [!TIP]
> The validation here is intentionally narrow: lowercase letters,
> digits, and underscores only.  This matches the character set
> Mastodon and Pixelfed accept in usernames, and keeps our actor URIs
> (which embed the username) safe without extra URL encoding.

Also add a tiny `GET /api/me` endpoint for the Vue side to consult:

~~~~ typescript [server/api/me.get.ts]
import { defineEventHandler } from "h3";
import { getLocalUser } from "../utils/users";

export default defineEventHandler(async () => {
  const user = await getLocalUser();
  return { user };
});
~~~~

### The setup page

Create *app/pages/setup.vue*.  It is a plain form that POSTs the body
fields to */api/signup* and redirects to `/` on success:

~~~~ vue [app/pages/setup.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
useHead({ title: "Set up PxShare" });

const username = ref("");
const name = ref("");
const error = ref<string | null>(null);
const submitting = ref(false);

async function submit() {
  error.value = null;
  submitting.value = true;
  try {
    await $fetch("/api/signup", {
      method: "POST",
      body: { username: username.value, name: name.value },
    });
    await navigateTo("/", { replace: true });
  } catch (e: unknown) {
    error.value =
      (e as { statusMessage?: string })?.statusMessage ??
      "Signup failed. Please try again.";
  } finally {
    submitting.value = false;
  }
}
</script>

<template>
  <section class="max-w-md mx-auto py-10">
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Set up your PxShare instance</h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-6">
      PxShare is a single-user federated service.  Choose the one account this
      instance will host.
    </p>
    <form class="flex flex-col gap-4" @submit.prevent="submit">
      <label class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <span class="text-sm font-medium">Username</span>
        <input
          v-model="username"
          required
          autocomplete="off"
          placeholder="alice"
          class="border border-gray-300 rounded px-3 py-2 focus:outline-none focus:border-brand"
        />
        <span class="text-xs text-gray-500">
          Lowercase letters, digits, and underscores only.  Fediverse actors
          will find you as <code>@username@your-domain</code>.
        </span>
      </label>
      <label class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <span class="text-sm font-medium">Display name</span>
        <input
          v-model="name"
          required
          placeholder="Alice"
          class="border border-gray-300 rounded px-3 py-2 focus:outline-none focus:border-brand"
        />
      </label>
      <p v-if="error" class="text-sm text-red-600">{{ error }}</p>
      <button
        type="submit"
        :disabled="submitting"
        class="bg-brand text-white rounded-full py-2 font-medium hover:bg-brand-dark disabled:opacity-50"
      >
        {{ submitting ? "Creating..." : "Create account" }}
      </button>
    </form>
  </section>
</template>
~~~~

### The first-run middleware

If we opened the browser now, */setup* would work but so would every
other page, including `/` with its “Welcome to PxShare” placeholder.
That is not what we want: a brand new instance should redirect you
straight to the setup page.

Nuxt route middleware can run before every navigation.  Create
*app/middleware/setup.global.ts*; the `.global.ts` suffix makes it
apply to every route automatically.

~~~~ typescript [app/middleware/setup.global.ts]
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware(async (to) => {
  if (to.path === "/setup") return;
  const { user } = await $fetch("/api/me");
  if (user === null) {
    return navigateTo("/setup", { replace: true });
  }
});
~~~~

The middleware skips over the */setup* route itself (otherwise we
would loop forever), asks the server whether a user exists, and
redirects to the setup page if not.

### Trying it out

With `npm run dev` running, visit <http://localhost:3000/>.  Because
no account exists yet, you land on the setup form:

![The setup form on a brand new instance, reached by visiting `/` which
the middleware rewrote to `/setup`.](./content-sharing/signup-form-empty.png)

Fill it in, submit, and you get bounced back to `/`:

![The home page after signup, reachable now that the instance has an
account.](./content-sharing/home-after-signup.png)

Verify the row with the `sqlite3` CLI:

~~~~ sh
sqlite3 content-sharing.sqlite3 "SELECT * FROM users"
~~~~

| `id` | `username` | `name`          | `created_at`          |
| ---- | ---------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| `1`  | `alice`    | `Alice Example` | `2026-04-25 03:20:13` |

And confirm the single-user constraint holds by attempting a second
signup:

~~~~ sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"bob","name":"Bob"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/signup
~~~~

~~~~ console
{"error":true,"statusCode":409,"statusMessage":"Account already exists on this instance."}
~~~~


Profile page
------------

Now that we have an account, let's give it a public profile page.
This is the page the world (and, eventually, other fediverse servers)
sees when they look up alice.  For now it is plain HTML; Chapter 7
will teach the same URL to speak ActivityPub as well.

### The API endpoint

Create *server/api/users/\[username].get.ts*.  The square brackets in
the filename make `username` a route parameter that Nuxt extracts for
us.

~~~~ typescript [server/api/users/&#91;username&#93;.get.ts]
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { createError, defineEventHandler, getRouterParam } from "h3";
import { db } from "../../db/client";
import { users } from "../../db/schema";

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const username = getRouterParam(event, "username");
  if (typeof username !== "string" || username === "") {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 404 });
  }
  const user = (
    await db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.username, username)).limit(1)
  )[0];
  if (user === undefined) {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 404 });
  }
  return { user };
});
~~~~

Drizzle's `eq(column, value)` builds the SQL `WHERE column = value`
clause in a typed way; you cannot accidentally swap the column with
the value.

### The Vue page

Create *app/pages/users/\[username].vue*.  `useFetch` is Nuxt's
server-aware fetch wrapper: during SSR it calls the endpoint as a
direct function, on the client it does a real network request.

~~~~ vue [app/pages/users/&#91;username&#93;.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const route = useRoute();
const username = computed(() => String(route.params.username));

const { data, error } = await useFetch(() => `/api/users/${username.value}`, {
  key: () => `user-${username.value}`,
});

if (error.value) {
  throw createError({ statusCode: 404, statusMessage: "User not found" });
}

const user = computed(() => data.value?.user ?? null);

useHead({
  title: () =>
    user.value ? `${user.value.name} (@${user.value.username})` : "PxShare",
});
</script>

<template>
  <section v-if="user" class="flex flex-col gap-6">
    <header class="flex items-center gap-4">
      <div
        class="w-20 h-20 rounded-full bg-brand/10 flex items-center justify-center text-3xl font-bold text-brand"
      >
        {{ user.name[0] }}
      </div>
      <div class="flex flex-col">
        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold">{{ user.name }}</h1>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">@{{ user.username }}</p>
      </div>
    </header>
    <div
      class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-1 min-h-40 text-sm text-gray-400 items-center justify-center"
    >
      <div class="col-span-3 text-center py-16">No posts yet.</div>
    </div>
  </section>
</template>
~~~~

The avatar circle is a placeholder showing the first letter of the
display name.  A real app would let the user upload an image; we
defer that to the reader as an exercise.

### Redirecting the home page

Right now our home page just says “Welcome to PxShare”.  Single-user
instances are friendlier if `/` takes you straight to the local
user's profile, so update *app/pages/index.vue*:

~~~~ vue [app/pages/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { data } = await useFetch("/api/me", { key: "me-home" });

definePageMeta({ middleware: [] });

if (data.value?.user) {
  await navigateTo(`/users/${data.value.user.username}`, { replace: true });
}
</script>

<template>
  <section class="text-center py-16">
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Welcome to PxShare</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-500">A tiny federated image sharing service.</p>
  </section>
</template>
~~~~

### Trying it out

Save the files and go to <http://localhost:3000/users/alice>:

![Alice's profile page: a pink circular avatar, her display name and
handle, and an empty “No posts yet.”
grid.](./content-sharing/profile-page-empty.png)

Open the root URL <http://localhost:3000/> and notice the redirect:
the home page now takes you straight to alice's profile.

Actor dispatcher
----------------

ActivityPub is a protocol for exchanging *activities* between *actors*.
Posting an image, liking it, commenting, following somebody: every
action a user takes on the fediverse is an activity, and every
activity travels from one actor to another.  Implementing the actor
is the first stop on the federation tour.

Our scaffolded *server/federation.ts* already declares a tiny actor.
Open it again:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/federation.ts]
import {
  createFederation,
  InProcessMessageQueue,
  MemoryKvStore,
} from "@fedify/fedify";
import { Person } from "@fedify/vocab";
import { getLogger } from "@logtape/logtape";

const logger = getLogger("content-sharing");

export const federation = createFederation({
  kv: new MemoryKvStore(),
  queue: new InProcessMessageQueue(),
});

federation.setActorDispatcher(
  "/users/{identifier}",
  async (ctx, identifier) => {
    return new Person({
      id: ctx.getActorUri(identifier),
      preferredUsername: identifier,
      name: identifier,
    });
  },
);

export default federation;
~~~~

The interesting line is `~Federatable.setActorDispatcher()`.  Whenever
another fediverse server fetches an actor URL on our service, Fedify
calls this callback with the matched `identifier` (the `{identifier}`
template variable, filled in from the URL) and a `Context` object.
The callback returns a [`Person`] (Fedify's typed representation of
an ActivityPub actor), and Fedify takes care of serializing it into
the right JSON-LD shape, attaching a JSON-LD context, and answering
with the correct content type.

`~Context.getActorUri()` reads the URL template you passed in and
hands back the canonical actor URI for that identifier.  Using the
context to mint URIs (instead of building strings yourself) means the
URLs always match what `setActorDispatcher` registered, even after
you put the app behind a reverse proxy or change the path.

The current dispatcher is a fib: it accepts *any* identifier and
hands back a freshly invented `Person`.  We want it to consult the
`users` table and refuse anything that is not a real account.

[`Person`]: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-person

### Reading the user from the database

Let's rewrite the dispatcher so it reads from `users`, returns `null`
when the identifier does not exist (Fedify turns that into a `404 Not Found`),
and emits a `Person` filled in with the data we have. Replace
*server/federation.ts* with this:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/federation.ts]
// @noErrors: 2304 2307
import {
  createFederation,
  InProcessMessageQueue,
  MemoryKvStore,
} from "@fedify/fedify";
import { Endpoints, Person } from "@fedify/vocab";
import { getLogger } from "@logtape/logtape";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { db } from "./db/client";
import { users } from "./db/schema";

const logger = getLogger("content-sharing");

export const federation = createFederation<void>({
  kv: new MemoryKvStore(),
  queue: new InProcessMessageQueue(),
});

federation.setActorDispatcher(
  "/users/{identifier}",
  async (ctx, identifier) => {
    const user = (
      await db
        .select()
        .from(users)
        .where(eq(users.username, identifier))
        .limit(1)
    )[0];
    if (user === undefined) return null;

    return new Person({
      id: ctx.getActorUri(identifier),
      preferredUsername: identifier,
      name: user.name,
      url: ctx.getActorUri(identifier),
      inbox: ctx.getInboxUri(identifier),
      endpoints: new Endpoints({
        sharedInbox: ctx.getInboxUri(),
      }),
      manuallyApprovesFollowers: false,
      discoverable: true,
      indexable: true,
    });
  },
);

federation.setInboxListeners("/users/{identifier}/inbox", "/inbox");

export default federation;
~~~~

A lot is happening here, so let's walk through it.

 -  *Database lookup.*  The query mirrors the one we wrote in
    *server/api/users/\[username].get.ts*: the dispatcher hands
    `identifier` to `eq(users.username, identifier)` and pulls the
    matching row.  When the row is missing, returning `null` lets
    Fedify respond with `404 Not Found` automatically.

 -  *Display name and profile URL.*  We hand the database's display
    name to the `Person` and pin the actor's profile URL to the same
    address other servers will use as the actor ID.  ActivityPub
    allows the actor ID and the profile URL to differ, but our app
    keeps them identical for simplicity.

 -  *Inbox and shared inbox.*  The `inbox` is the URL where other
    servers POST activities addressed to alice; a Mastodon user's
    `Follow` will land here.  The [`Endpoints.sharedInbox`] is a
    single inbox that handles activities addressed to anyone on our
    server; busy instances rely on it to deliver one copy of a
    public post instead of one POST per follower.  Both URLs come
    from `~Context.getInboxUri()`, which returns the per-actor inbox
    when called with an identifier and the shared inbox when called
    without arguments.

 -  *Pixelfed-friendly flags.*  `manuallyApprovesFollowers: false`,
    `discoverable: true`, and `indexable: true` tell other servers
    and search crawlers that alice is happy to be found, indexed,
    and auto-followed.  Pixelfed in particular reads `discoverable`
    to decide whether a remote profile shows up in its explore feed.
    An unflagged actor often appears as a blank or pending profile
    on Pixelfed, so we set the trio up front.

 -  *Registering the inbox path.*  `~Context.getInboxUri()` complains
    if no inbox path has been registered yet; even though we are not
    handling activities in this chapter, calling
    `~Federatable.setInboxListeners()` with empty bodies is enough to
    make the call succeed.  We will fill in the listener bodies in
    [*Handling follows*](#handling-follows).

### Looking the actor up

Save the file.  The dev server should pick the change up
automatically; if it does not, restart it with `npm run dev`.

In a separate terminal, ask Fedify's CLI to look the actor up:

~~~~ sh
fedify lookup http://localhost:3000/users/alice
~~~~

You should see something close to this:

~~~~ console
- Looking up the object...
✔ Fetched object: http://localhost:3000/users/alice
Person {
  id: URL 'http://localhost:3000/users/alice',
  name: 'Alice Example',
  url: URL 'http://localhost:3000/users/alice',
  preferredUsername: 'alice',
  manuallyApprovesFollowers: false,
  inbox: URL 'http://localhost:3000/users/alice/inbox',
  endpoints: Endpoints { sharedInbox: URL 'http://localhost:3000/inbox' },
  discoverable: true,
  indexable: true
}
✔ Successfully fetched the object.
~~~~

Every property we set on the `Person` shows up in the response,
flags included.  Now try a username that does not exist:

~~~~ sh
fedify lookup http://localhost:3000/users/nobody
~~~~

The dispatcher returns `null`, so Fedify answers `404 Not Found`:

~~~~ console
- Looking up the object...
✖ Failed to fetch http://localhost:3000/users/nobody
Error: It may be a private object.  Try with -a/--authorized-fetch.
~~~~

> [!TIP]
> The fediverse uses `404 Not Found` to mean both <q>this account
> never existed</q> and <q>this account is private and you are not
> allowed to see it</q>; Fedify's lookup hint nudges you to retry
> with [`fedify lookup --authorized-fetch`].  Our actor is public, so
> the hint does not apply here, but you will see this message a lot
> when poking at Mastodon's hidden profiles.

[`fedify lookup --authorized-fetch`]: ../cli.md#fedify-lookup

### Browser still gets HTML

The HTML profile page from [*Profile page*](#profile-page) is
unchanged.  Visit
<http://localhost:3000/users/alice> in your browser and the same Vue
page renders, because Fedify only intercepts requests whose
<code>Accept</code> header asks for ActivityPub-flavored JSON.

You can confirm both responses come from the same URL:

~~~~ sh
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{content_type}\n" \
  -H "Accept: text/html" http://localhost:3000/users/alice
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{content_type}\n" \
  -H "Accept: application/activity+json" http://localhost:3000/users/alice
~~~~

~~~~ console
200 text/html;charset=utf-8
200 application/activity+json
~~~~

> [!NOTE]
> [`@fedify/nuxt`][fedify-nuxt] implements this by registering its middleware
> ahead of Nuxt's pages.  Every incoming request goes through Fedify first; if
> Fedify recognizes the URL and the <code>Accept</code> header, it answers
> directly.  Otherwise it falls through to Nuxt and our Vue page handles it.
> Both worlds share the same route table, so we never have to keep two URL
> schemes in sync.

With a real actor in place, the next chapter teaches alice how to
*sign* the activities she sends and verify the ones she receives.


Cryptographic key pairs
-----------------------

Every activity that flows between fediverse servers carries a
[digital signature].  When alice sends a `Follow` to a Mastodon user,
Mastodon expects her server to sign the request with alice's private
key and to publish the matching public key on alice's actor.  The
receiving side fetches the public key, verifies the signature, and
trusts that the activity really came from alice's server.  Without
this handshake, anyone could impersonate her.

Fedify takes care of the signing and the verification on every
incoming and outgoing activity.  What it does not do is *create* the
keys, because alice has to own them; they are the only thing keeping
her account hers.  This chapter wires up that ownership.

### Two algorithms, side by side

The fediverse is in the middle of a slow transition from
[RSA-PKCS#1-v1.5] signatures to [Ed25519] signatures.  Mastodon and
Pixelfed verify both, while older Misskey installs and a long tail
of niche servers still expect only RSA.  Carrying both key types is
the safest option, so our table will hold two rows per user, one
per algorithm.

[Ed25519]: https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/

### The `actor_keys` table

Open *server/db/schema.ts* and add an `actorKeys` table after the
`users` table:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/db/schema.ts]
import { sql } from "drizzle-orm";
import {
  check,
  integer,
  primaryKey,
  sqliteTable,
  text,
} from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

export const users = sqliteTable(
  "users",
  {
    id: integer("id").primaryKey({ autoIncrement: false }),
    username: text("username").notNull(),
    name: text("name").notNull(),
    createdAt: text("created_at").notNull().default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`),
  },
  (t) => [check("users_single_user", sql`${t.id} = 1`)],
);

export type User = typeof users.$inferSelect;

export const actorKeys = sqliteTable(
  "actor_keys",
  {
    userId: integer("user_id")
      .notNull()
      .references(() => users.id),
    type: text("type", { enum: ["RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5", "Ed25519"] }).notNull(),
    privateKey: text("private_key").notNull(),
    publicKey: text("public_key").notNull(),
    createdAt: text("created_at").notNull().default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`),
  },
  (t) => [primaryKey({ columns: [t.userId, t.type] })],
);

export type ActorKey = typeof actorKeys.$inferSelect;
~~~~

A few things to notice:

 -  *Composite primary key.*  The combination of `userId` and `type`
    is the row's identity; one user gets exactly one row per
    algorithm, so the table can hold at most two rows for alice.
 -  *Foreign key to `users`.*  The reference makes sure a key row
    cannot exist without an owner, which gives us cascade-friendly
    cleanup if we ever delete a user.
 -  *Both keys as text.*  We will store both halves of the pair as
    serialized [JWK] objects.  JWK is JSON-shaped, so a `text`
    column works without any binary handling.
 -  *Algorithm enum.*  `text("type", { enum: [...] })` gives Drizzle
    a TypeScript-level union for the column, so the dispatcher cannot
    accidentally write a typo like `"ed25519"` (lowercase) without
    failing to compile.

Push the change to SQLite:

~~~~ sh
npm run db:push
~~~~

> [!TIP]
> If `db:push` complains that an index already exists, that is a
> known quirk of `drizzle-kit push` re-running idempotent statements.
> The new `actor_keys` table is still created.  You can also wipe
> the dev database and re-run if you prefer a clean slate:
>
> ~~~~ sh
> rm -f content-sharing.sqlite3*
> npm run db:push
> ~~~~

### The key pairs dispatcher

Open *server/federation.ts*.  We will add three Fedify helpers
(`generateCryptoKeyPair()`, `exportJwk()`, `importJwk()`), pull in
the `actorKeys` table, and chain a `setKeyPairsDispatcher` onto the
existing dispatcher chain:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/federation.ts]
// @noErrors: 2304 2307 7006

  createFederation,
  exportJwk,
  generateCryptoKeyPair,

import { getLogger } from "@logtape/logtape";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";

const logger = getLogger("content-sharing");

export const federation = createFederation<void>({

});

federation
  .setActorDispatcher("/users/{identifier}", async (ctx, identifier) => {
    const user = (
      await db
        .select()
        .from(users)
        .where(eq(users.username, identifier))
        .limit(1)
    )[0];
    if (user === undefined) return null;

    const keys = await ctx.getActorKeyPairs(identifier);
    return new Person({
      id: ctx.getActorUri(identifier),
      preferredUsername: identifier,

  })

      const row = stored[keyType];
      if (row === undefined) {
        logger.debug(
          "User {identifier} has no {keyType} key; generating one.",
          { identifier, keyType },
        );
        const { privateKey, publicKey } = await generateCryptoKeyPair(keyType);
        await db.insert(actorKeys).values({
          userId: user.id,
          type: keyType,
          privateKey: JSON.stringify(await exportJwk(privateKey)),
          publicKey: JSON.stringify(await exportJwk(publicKey)),
        });
        pairs.push({ privateKey, publicKey });
      } else {
        pairs.push({
          privateKey: await importJwk(JSON.parse(row.privateKey), "private"),
          publicKey: await importJwk(JSON.parse(row.publicKey), "public"),
        });
      }
    }
    return pairs;
  });

federation.setInboxListeners("/users/{identifier}/inbox", "/inbox");

export default federation;
~~~~

This is one of the longer pieces of code in the tutorial, but it
breaks down into three movements.

 -  *The dispatcher chain.*  `~Federatable.setActorDispatcher()`
    returns an `ActorCallbackSetters` object, so we can chain
    `~ActorCallbackSetters.setKeyPairsDispatcher()` straight onto it.
    Whenever Fedify needs alice's keys, this callback runs.

 -  *Lazy generation.*  The callback first reads any existing rows
    from `actor_keys`.  If a row for a given algorithm is missing,
    it calls [`generateCryptoKeyPair()`] to create a new pair, calls
    [`exportJwk()`] to serialize both halves to JSON, and inserts
    them.  Existing rows are deserialized back into [`CryptoKey`]
    objects with [`importJwk()`].  This way alice never has to
    “set up” her account; the first ActivityPub fetch produces her
    keys on demand.

 -  *Wiring the keys onto the actor.*  Inside the actor dispatcher,
    we call `~Context.getActorKeyPairs()` to get back an array of
    rich key descriptors.  We pass the first key's
    `cryptographicKey` to `publicKey` (the legacy slot expected by
    older software) and map the whole array's `multikey` field to
    `assertionMethods` (the modern slot, which can carry several
    keys).

> [!TIP]
> Why two `publicKey`-shaped properties?  Originally ActivityPub had
> only `publicKey`, and many implementations still assume it holds
> exactly one key.  [FEP-521a] introduced `assertionMethods` to
> register multiple keys at once.  Setting both means RSA-only and
> Ed25519-aware servers can each find a key they recognize.

### Looking the actor up again

Restart the dev server (or save the file and let HMR pick it up) and
ask Fedify to look alice up.  The first lookup is the one that
populates `actor_keys`.

~~~~ sh
fedify lookup http://localhost:3000/users/alice
~~~~

The response now carries a `publicKey` and an `assertionMethods`
array, in addition to the properties from
[*Actor dispatcher*](#actor-dispatcher):

~~~~ console
✔ Fetched object: http://localhost:3000/users/alice
Person {
  id: URL 'http://localhost:3000/users/alice',
  name: 'Alice Example',
  url: URL 'http://localhost:3000/users/alice',
  preferredUsername: 'alice',
  publicKey: CryptographicKey {
    id: URL 'http://localhost:3000/users/alice#main-key',
    owner: URL 'http://localhost:3000/users/alice',
    publicKey: CryptoKey {
      type: 'public',
      algorithm: { name: 'RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5', modulusLength: 4096, ... },
    },
  },
  assertionMethods: [
    Multikey { id: URL '.../alice#multikey-1', algorithm: 'RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5' },
    Multikey { id: URL '.../alice#multikey-2', algorithm: 'Ed25519' },
  ],
  inbox: URL 'http://localhost:3000/users/alice/inbox',
  endpoints: Endpoints { sharedInbox: URL 'http://localhost:3000/inbox' },
  manuallyApprovesFollowers: false,
  discoverable: true,
  indexable: true,
}
~~~~

If you peek inside the database, you can see both rows landed:

~~~~ sh
sqlite3 content-sharing.sqlite3 "SELECT user_id, type FROM actor_keys"
~~~~

| `user_id` | `type`              |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| `1`       | `RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5` |
| `1`       | `Ed25519`           |

A second `fedify lookup` does not create new rows; the dispatcher
notices both algorithms are already present and just hands the
existing keys back to Fedify.

### WebFinger comes for free

Most fediverse software does not start with a URL like
`http://localhost:3000/users/alice`; it starts with a handle, like
`@alice@example.com`.  To turn the handle into a URL, the software
asks the host for a [WebFinger] resource:

~~~~ sh
curl 'http://localhost:3000/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:alice@localhost:3000'
~~~~

~~~~ console
{
  "subject": "acct:alice@localhost:3000",
  "aliases": ["http://localhost:3000/users/alice"],
  "links": [
    { "rel": "self",
      "href": "http://localhost:3000/users/alice",
      "type": "application/activity+json" },
    { "rel": "http://webfinger.net/rel/profile-page",
      "href": "http://localhost:3000/users/alice" }
  ]
}
~~~~

We did not write a WebFinger endpoint.  Fedify wires one up
automatically the moment `setActorDispatcher` is registered, using
the same `{identifier}` template as a hint.  When
[*First federation test*](#first-federation-test) puts the
app behind a public hostname, that hostname will be all another
server needs to discover and verify alice.

With keys, signatures, and discovery in place, the next chapter
points alice's local instance at the public internet for the first
time, and gets Mastodon and Pixelfed to fetch her profile.

[WebFinger]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7033


First federation test
---------------------

Alice's profile, keys, and WebFinger response all live at
*localhost:3000*, which is not a place the rest of the fediverse can
reach.  To make sure our tutorial code talks to real ActivityPub
software, we need a public URL that proxies through to the local
dev server.  Fedify ships exactly that, in the form of `fedify tunnel`.

### Running `fedify tunnel`

Open a second terminal so the dev server keeps running, and start
the tunnel:

~~~~ sh
fedify tunnel 3000
~~~~

After a couple of seconds, the CLI prints a publicly reachable URL:

~~~~ console
- Creating a secure tunnel...
✔ Your local server at 3000 is now publicly accessible:

"https://cc001590e20ab0.lhr.life/"
 Press ^C to close the tunnel.
~~~~

The exact subdomain changes every session.  We will refer to it as
*&lt;tunnel&gt;* for the rest of the chapter; copy your real URL into
the commands below.

> [!TIP]
> `fedify tunnel` rotates between three free SSH-based services
> (`fedify.com.es`, `serveo.net`, `pinggy.io`) so it does not depend
> on you signing up for anything.  If a session drops or refuses to
> start, run the command again, or pin a specific service with `-s`,
> for example `fedify tunnel -s pinggy.io 3000`.  When all three
> misbehave, [`cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000`] and
> [`ngrok http 3000`] are good fallbacks; the rest of the tutorial
> works with whichever public URL you ended up with.

[`cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000`]: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/
[`ngrok http 3000`]: https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/

### Allowing the tunnel host in Nuxt

If you try to open the tunnel URL right away, Nuxt's dev server will
refuse with a *Blocked request* page.  This is a Vite security
feature: in development it only answers requests whose
<code>Host</code> header matches one of the allowed hosts.  Tell
Vite to accept any host so it does not matter which tunneling
service `fedify tunnel` ends up using.  Edit *nuxt.config.ts*:

~~~~ typescript [nuxt.config.ts]
// https://nuxt.com/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@fedify/nuxt", "@unocss/nuxt"],
  fedify: { federationModule: "#server/federation" },
  ssr: true,
  css: ["~/assets/styles.css"],
  vite: {
    server: {
      // Accept any `Host` header during development.  Whichever
      // tunneling service we point `fedify tunnel` at, the dev
      // server will answer.  Production builds ignore this option.
      allowedHosts: true,
    },
  },
});
~~~~

Save the file; Nuxt restarts automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> `allowedHosts: true` only loosens the Vite *dev* server, which
> never runs in production.  `npm run build` ignores the option,
> so deployed instances still rely on the reverse proxy in front
> of them to reject unknown hostnames.

### Smoke test from the command line

With the tunnel up and Nuxt happy, fetch alice's actor through the
public URL.  Use `fedify lookup` so we exercise the full WebFinger
to actor flow:

~~~~ sh
fedify lookup @alice@<tunnel>
~~~~

You should get back the same `Person` object we saw in
[*Cryptographic key pairs*](#cryptographic-key-pairs),
except every URL now starts with the tunnel's hostname:

~~~~ console
✔ Fetched object: https://<tunnel>/users/alice
Person {
  id: URL 'https://<tunnel>/users/alice',
  inbox: URL 'https://<tunnel>/users/alice/inbox',
  endpoints: Endpoints { sharedInbox: URL 'https://<tunnel>/inbox' },
  publicKey: CryptographicKey { ... },
  assertionMethods: [ Multikey { ... }, Multikey { ... } ],
  ...
}
~~~~

Fedify uses the [`X-Forwarded-*`] headers the tunnel attaches to
every request to figure out the public origin.  That is why the
URL on the actor flips from `http://localhost:3000` to
`https://<tunnel>` automatically; nothing in our code had to know
the tunnel hostname.

[`X-Forwarded-*`]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For

### Looking alice up from Mastodon

Now for the actual federation test.  Open
<https://activitypub.academy/> in a new browser tab.  The Academy is
an open Mastodon instance for ActivityPub experimentation: every
sign-up gets an ephemeral account that is deleted the next day, so
no real identity is involved.  Click *Sign up*, accept the privacy
policy, and you land in a fresh Mastodon UI.

In the search box at the top left, paste the actor URL from the
tunnel:

~~~~ text
https://<tunnel>/users/alice
~~~~

Mastodon performs an authenticated fetch to your tunnel, follows
the WebFinger pointer, and shows the result inline:

![Search results panel on activitypub.academy showing one entry,
“Alice Example  @alice@&lt;tunnel&gt;”, with a generic mascot
avatar.](./content-sharing/academy-search-alice.png)

Click the result (or navigate directly to
*https://activitypub.academy/@alice@&lt;tunnel&gt;*) to see alice
rendered as a fully-fledged remote profile, complete with a *Follow*
button:

![Mastodon profile view of Alice Example showing her display name,
the federated handle, “Joined 25 Apr 2026”, and zero posts, zero
following, zero followers.](./content-sharing/academy-alice-profile.png)

The avatar is a default placeholder because we never wired one up
for alice.  The *Follow* button is a clickable button, but no
follow flow runs yet; the inbox handler that turns the academy's
incoming `Follow` activity into a follower record is what we build
in [*Handling follows*](#handling-follows).

### Looking alice up from Pixelfed

Mastodon was the first proof point.  Pixelfed is the second, and
it has a slightly different interface but the same underlying
ActivityPub plumbing.  If you do not already have a Pixelfed
account, pick an instance from the [official server list] and sign
up; any instance with open registration and federation enabled is
fine.

Once you are signed in, Pixelfed's URL pattern for remote profiles
is *&lt;your-instance&gt;/@username@host*, so navigating to
*https://&lt;your-instance&gt;/@alice@&lt;tunnel&gt;* triggers a
federation fetch and renders alice's profile:

![Pixelfed profile view of Alice Example with the federated handle,
the default placeholder avatar, three counters (0 Posts, 0
Followers, 0 Following), and a blue Follow
button.](./content-sharing/pixelfed-alice-profile.png)

Notice that Pixelfed shows the counters even though we have not
exposed a `followers` or `following` collection yet; it is happy to
default to zero when those endpoints are missing.

> [!TIP]
> Pixelfed's quick-search dropdown sometimes prefills the input
> with `[object Object]` when you press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on a
> remote-account result.  Navigate by URL instead (or restart the
> tab and try the dropdown again).  This is a Pixelfed UI quirk
> unrelated to our server.

[official server list]: https://pixelfed.org/servers

### What just happened?

Three things had to line up for this chapter to work, all of which
have been quietly built up over the previous chapters:

 -  *WebFinger.*  Both Mastodon and Pixelfed asked our tunnel for
    `acct:alice@<tunnel>`, and Fedify answered using the actor
    dispatcher we registered in
    [*Actor dispatcher*](#actor-dispatcher).
 -  *Signed actor fetch.*  The remote servers signed their request
    with their own actor's keys; Fedify verified the signature
    against the public key it fetched from the remote server.
 -  *Public keys advertised on alice.*  Once Mastodon or Pixelfed
    cached alice's actor JSON, they recorded the keys we generated
    in [*Cryptographic key pairs*](#cryptographic-key-pairs).  When
    alice eventually sends activities back, the
    receiver will already know which key to verify against.

Nothing in our code knows about Mastodon or Pixelfed specifically.
ActivityPub is a single protocol, and the chapters that follow will
add behavior by adding handlers, not by special-casing servers.

> [!CAUTION]
> Stop the tunnel (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>) when you are not actively
> testing federation.  A live tunnel exposes your dev server to the entire
> internet, including unsolicited probing traffic.  Keys remain safe (they sit
> in your local SQLite file), but you do not want to leave a development
> backend reachable longer than necessary.

With the federation pipe open, the next chapter teaches alice how
to *accept* the `Follow` activities Mastodon and Pixelfed are eager
to send.


Handling follows
----------------

The *Follow* button you saw on the federation test does nothing
useful yet.  Mastodon already sent a `Follow` activity to alice's
inbox the moment you clicked it; our scaffolded inbox just logged a
warning and dropped the request.  This chapter wires up the inbox
so a remote `Follow` actually creates a follower record and sends
back the `Accept` reply Mastodon needs to flip the button to
*Following*.

### What an inbox is

Every actor in ActivityPub has its own *inbox*: an HTTP endpoint
that accepts signed `POST` requests carrying activities.  When
somebody likes alice's post, the `Like` lands in alice's inbox.
When somebody follows alice, the `Follow` lands in her inbox.
A server can also expose a *shared inbox* (the `endpoints.sharedInbox`
URL we set in [*Actor dispatcher*](#actor-dispatcher)) for
activities that target many local
actors at once; busy instances rely on it to deliver one copy of a
public post instead of one POST per follower.

Fedify already speaks the inbox protocol.  The
`~Federatable.setInboxListeners()` call we added in
[*Actor dispatcher*](#actor-dispatcher)
registers the routes; the empty body just acknowledges every
request with a `202 Accepted`.  Adding behavior is a matter of
chaining `~InboxListenerSetters.on()`.

### The `followers` table

Open *server/db/schema.ts* and add an `actorKeys`-style
`followers` table after `actorKeys`:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/db/schema.ts]
import { sql } from "drizzle-orm";
import {
  check,
  integer,
  primaryKey,
  sqliteTable,
  text,
} from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

export const users = sqliteTable(
  "users",
  {
    id: integer("id").primaryKey({ autoIncrement: false }),
    username: text("username").notNull(),
    name: text("name").notNull(),
    createdAt: text("created_at").notNull().default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`),
  },
  (t) => [check("users_single_user", sql`${t.id} = 1`)],
);
// ---cut---
// Remote actors that follow the local user.  Stored denormalized:
// we keep just enough to address the actor when fanning out
// activities (`inboxUrl`, `sharedInboxUrl`) and to render a basic
// "Followers" list (`handle`, `name`, `url`).
export const followers = sqliteTable(
  "followers",
  {
    followingId: integer("following_id")
      .notNull()
      .references(() => users.id),
    actorUri: text("actor_uri").notNull(),
    handle: text("handle").notNull(),
    name: text("name"),
    inboxUrl: text("inbox_url").notNull(),
    sharedInboxUrl: text("shared_inbox_url"),
    url: text("url"),
    createdAt: text("created_at").notNull().default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`),
  },
  (t) => [primaryKey({ columns: [t.followingId, t.actorUri] })],
);

export type Follower = typeof followers.$inferSelect;
~~~~

A few columns deserve a comment:

 -  *Composite primary key.*  `(followingId, actorUri)` is the row's
    identity.  A single remote actor can follow alice exactly once;
    a re-follow updates the same row instead of inserting a new one.
 -  *Cached profile fields.*  We could refetch the actor every time
    we need to display followers, but caching `handle`, `name`,
    `url` makes the followers list cheap to render and survives
    transient outages on the remote server.
 -  *`inboxUrl` plus `sharedInboxUrl`.*  Fedify's
    `~Context.sendActivity()` will prefer the shared inbox when it
    is available, falling back to the per-actor inbox.  Storing
    both up front lets later chapters fan out posts efficiently.

Push the schema:

~~~~ sh
npm run db:push
~~~~

### The `Follow` listener

Open *server/federation.ts*.  Add `Accept`, `Follow`, and
`getActorHandle` to the `@fedify/vocab` import, pull in the new
`followers` table, and chain a listener onto
`~Federatable.setInboxListeners()`:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/federation.ts]
// @noErrors: 2304 2307 7006

  createFederation,
  exportJwk,
  generateCryptoKeyPair,

import { getLogger } from "@logtape/logtape";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";

export const federation = createFederation<void>({

Before we dig into the listener body, notice the new option on
`createFederation`:

~~~~ typescript
firstKnock: "draft-cavage-http-signatures-12",
~~~~

ActivityPub servers sign every outbound delivery so the receiver
can prove the activity really came from the claimed actor.  The
modern signature spec is [RFC 9421] (HTTP Message Signatures); its
predecessor is the [draft-cavage-http-signatures] spec that
Mastodon shipped first and that most fediverse software
implemented before RFC 9421 stabilized.  Fedify defaults to
RFC 9421 and double-knocks back to draft-cavage if the first try
fails.  That fallback works against Mastodon, GoToSocial, and
anything else that returns a 4xx for unknown signature formats.
Pixelfed, however, accepts the inbox POST with HTTP 200 *before*
checking the signature, then drops the activity silently when its
queue worker cannot parse the RFC 9421 header.  Forcing the first
knock to draft-cavage keeps Pixelfed in the loop without
sacrificing modern peers, who upgrade us back to RFC 9421 on the
return trip anyway.

Walking through the listener:

 -  *Validating the target.*  `~Context.parseUri()` turns
    `follow.objectId` (the actor URL inside the `Follow`) back into
    the `{identifier}` we registered the dispatcher with.  If the
    URL is not one of our actors, we log and bail out so we never
    accidentally accept follows for accounts we do not own.

 -  *Fetching the follower.*  `follow.getActor()` returns the
    sending actor as a typed object; if the activity arrived without
    a usable actor (no inbox, no ID), we cannot send `Accept` back,
    so again we drop the request.

 -  *Recording the follower.*  Drizzle's
    `insert(...).values(...) .onConflictDoUpdate(...)` is the SQLite equivalent
    of a real upsert.  The `onConflictDoUpdate` payload re-applies the cached
    fields, so a remote actor changing their display name eventually flows
    through the next time they re-follow.

 -  *Sending the `Accept`.*  `~Context.sendActivity()` takes the
    sender (the parsed actor target), the recipient (the remote
    follower), and the activity to send.  We construct an `Accept`
    whose `object` references the original `Follow`; that is how
    Mastodon and Pixelfed correlate our reply with their pending
    follow.

 -  *The explicit `id` on the `Accept`.*  Fedify will auto-generate
    an id if you do not provide one, but the auto-generated form
    (`https://<host>/#Accept/<uuid>`) confuses some peers because
    it is not anchored under any actor's URI.  Building the id
    under alice's URI (`<actor>#accepts/<uuid>`) follows the
    convention Mastodon uses and works on every implementation we
    tested.

 -  *Reconstructing a minimal `Follow` for the `object`.*  Fedify
    hydrates the inbound `Follow` so that `follow.actor` is the
    full `Person` object.  When we serialize the same `follow`
    inline as our Accept's object, that nested `Person` rides
    along.  Pixelfed's `AcceptValidator` requires `object.actor`
    and `object.object` to be URL strings (its `'url'` validation
    rule) and silently rejects payloads where they are nested
    objects.  Building a fresh `Follow({ id, actor, object })`
    from the original URL fields keeps every other peer happy and
    unblocks Pixelfed's `handleAcceptActivity`.

### Trying it from Mastodon

Restart the dev server if it is not already running, make sure
your `fedify tunnel` URL still reaches alice (`fedify lookup @alice@<tunnel>`
should still work), and head over to your ActivityPub.Academy tab.

Search for alice (paste the actor URL into the search box at the
top left), open her profile, and click *Follow*.  Within a second
or two the button flips:

![Mastodon's view of alice's profile after a successful follow:
the Follow button has become a red Unfollow button, a bell icon
appears next to it, and the follower count reads “1 Follower”
instead of zero.](./content-sharing/academy-after-follow.png)

The button only flips because Mastodon received the `Accept(Follow)`
our listener sent.  Without the `Accept`, the button stays
*Pending* indefinitely.

Now check the local database:

~~~~ sh
sqlite3 -header -column content-sharing.sqlite3 \
  "SELECT following_id, handle, inbox_url FROM followers"
~~~~

| `following_id` | `handle`                                 | `inbox_url`                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1`            | `@anbelia_doshaelen@activitypub.academy` | `https://activitypub.academy/users/anbelia_doshaelen/inbox` |

The Academy assigned your account a randomly-generated name; yours
will read differently, but the `following_id = 1` and a real
`/inbox` URL are the proof that the round trip happened.

### Trying it from Pixelfed

We are building a Pixelfed-style service, so the Pixelfed side of
the protocol matters at least as much as the Mastodon side.
Switch to your Pixelfed tab, paste the actor handle
(`@alice@<tunnel>`) into the search bar, and open the profile from
the dropdown.  Click *Follow*.

The dev log records the matching round trip; you should see lines
like:

~~~~ console
INF fedify·federation·inbox Activity 'https://<your-pixelfed-instance>/users/.../#follow/...' is enqueued.
INF fedify·federation·http 'POST' '/inbox': 202
INF fedify·federation·inbox Activity '...' has been processed.
INF fedify·federation·outbox Successfully sent activity 'https://<tunnel>/users/alice#accepts/...' to 'https://<your-pixelfed-instance>/users/.../inbox'.
~~~~

Re-run the database query and you will see two rows, one per
remote actor:

~~~~ sh
sqlite3 -header -column content-sharing.sqlite3 \
  "SELECT following_id, handle, inbox_url FROM followers"
~~~~

| `following_id` | `handle`                                 | `inbox_url`                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1`            | `@anbelia_doshaelen@activitypub.academy` | `https://activitypub.academy/users/anbelia_doshaelen/inbox` |
| `1`            | `@you@<your-pixelfed-instance>`          | `https://<your-pixelfed-instance>/users/you/inbox`          |

After Pixelfed's queue picks the activity up, the *Follow* button
flips to *Unfollow* on alice's profile:

![alice's profile rendered on a Pixelfed instance after the round
trip succeeds.  The follow button now reads *Unfollow*; the
counters still read 0/0/0 because alice does not yet expose a
followers collection (we add it in *Followers list and
collection*).](./content-sharing/pixelfed-after-follow.png)

Same handler, two very different servers, identical outcome.
That is the win condition for an ActivityPub server: behavior
should follow from activity types, not from special-casing the
remote brand.

> [!TIP]
> If the follower row never lands, the most likely culprits are:
>
>  -  The tunnel URL changed since the actor was last fetched.
>     Both Mastodon and Pixelfed cache actor data, including the
>     inbox URL; clear the remote tab, fetch alice again, and
>     retry the follow.
>  -  The dev server is no longer running.  Vite's hot reload
>     makes it easy to think the process is alive when it has
>     actually exited; check `tail` on your dev log.
>  -  Signature verification failed.  Fedify's logs name the
>     actor and key it tried to verify against, but `info` level
>     hides the line that explains *why* the verification failed.
>     Open *server/logging.ts* and lower the `fedify` logger's
>     `lowestLevel` from `"info"` to `"debug"` for the duration
>     of the debugging session, then restart the dev server.

The next chapter rounds the symmetric case out: handling the
`Undo(Follow)` activity Mastodon and Pixelfed send when somebody
clicks *Unfollow*.


Handling unfollows
------------------

When a remote actor unfollows alice, the originating server sends
an [`Undo`] activity whose inner `object` is the original `Follow`:

~~~~ json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "id": "https://activitypub.academy/users/anbelia_doshaelen#follows/9867/undo",
  "type": "Undo",
  "actor": "https://activitypub.academy/users/anbelia_doshaelen",
  "object": {
    "id": "https://activitypub.academy/<...>",
    "type": "Follow",
    "actor": "https://activitypub.academy/users/anbelia_doshaelen",
    "object": "https://<tunnel>/users/alice"
  }
}
~~~~

Without a handler, our inbox happily accepts the activity (HTTP 202)
and ignores it; the `followers` row keeps living.  We need to
delete it.

[`Undo`]: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-undo

### The `Undo` listener

Open *server/federation.ts* once more.  Add `Undo` to the imports
from `@fedify/vocab` and `and` to the imports from `drizzle-orm`,
then chain a fourth listener after the `Follow` handler:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/federation.ts]
// @noErrors: 2304 2307 2304 7006
import {
  createFederation,
  exportJwk,
  generateCryptoKeyPair,
  importJwk,
  InProcessMessageQueue,
  MemoryKvStore,
} from "@fedify/fedify";
import {
  Accept,
  Endpoints,
  Follow,
  getActorHandle,
  Person,
  Undo,
} from "@fedify/vocab";
import { getLogger } from "@logtape/logtape";
import { and, eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { db } from "./db/client";
import { actorKeys, followers, users } from "./db/schema";

// (createFederation, the actor and key-pairs dispatchers, and the
// `on(Follow, ...)` listener from earlier chapters live here.)

federation
  .setInboxListeners("/users/{identifier}/inbox", "/inbox")
  .on(Follow, async (ctx, follow) => { /* from earlier */ })
  .on(Undo, async (ctx, undo) => {
    const object = await undo.getObject();
    if (!(object instanceof Follow)) return;
    if (undo.actorId == null || object.objectId == null) return;
    const target = ctx.parseUri(object.objectId);
    if (target?.type !== "actor") return;
    const localUser = (
      await db
        .select()
        .from(users)
        .where(eq(users.username, target.identifier))
        .limit(1)
    )[0];
    if (localUser === undefined) return;
    await db
      .delete(followers)
      .where(
        and(
          eq(followers.followingId, localUser.id),
          eq(followers.actorUri, undo.actorId.href),
        ),
      );
  });
~~~~

Walking through the listener:

 -  *Verifying the inner type.*  `undo.getObject()` resolves the
    activity nested under `Undo.object`.  An `Undo` can wrap many
    activity types (`Like`, `Announce`, `Block`, …); we only care
    about `Follow`, so we discard everything else.

 -  *Confirming the target.*  Just like the `Follow` listener, we
    pass the inner Follow's `objectId` through `~Context.parseUri()`
    to make sure the unfollow is aimed at one of *our* actors.
    Otherwise we silently bail.

 -  *Identifying the row to delete.*  We delete on `undo.actorId`
    (the URI of the actor sending the `Undo`).  Fedify has already
    verified the HTTP signature on the inbox POST; if a hostile
    peer tried to forge an `Undo` on behalf of somebody else, the
    signature check would have rejected the delivery before our
    handler ever ran.

 -  *Drizzle's composite delete.*  `and(...)` combines the two
    `eq(...)` predicates so the `WHERE` clause matches both
    columns of the table's composite primary key, guaranteeing we
    only ever drop the one row we mean to.

> [!NOTE]
> Some implementations send `Undo(Follow)` even when the original
> `Follow` was never accepted, e.g. when the remote user cancels a
> pending follow request before it landed.  Our handler treats the
> missing row case implicitly: `db.delete(...)` on a row that does
> not exist is a no-op, no error.  Idempotent, by design.

### Trying it from Mastodon

Restart the dev server (or save the file and let HMR pick it up).
On your ActivityPub.Academy tab, navigate back to alice's profile.
You should still see the *Unfollow* button from the previous
chapter; click it.

Within a second or two, the dev log records an `Undo(Follow)`
landing in alice's inbox:

~~~~ console
INF fedify·federation·inbox Activity 'https://activitypub.academy/users/<acct>#follows/<id>/undo' is enqueued.
INF fedify·federation·http 'POST' '/users/alice/inbox': 202
INF fedify·federation·inbox Activity '...#follows/<id>/undo' has been processed.
~~~~

The Mastodon UI flips the button back to *Follow* and the follower
counter ticks down.  The same SQL we ran in
[*Handling follows*](#handling-follows) confirms
the row is gone:

~~~~ sh
sqlite3 -header -column content-sharing.sqlite3 \
  "SELECT following_id, handle FROM followers"
~~~~

The Academy row no longer appears.

### Trying it from Pixelfed

Switch back to your Pixelfed tab, open alice's profile, and click
*Unfollow*.  The same round trip happens: Pixelfed sends an
`Undo(Follow)`, our listener parses it, the row is removed.
Pixelfed's UI flips the button back to *Follow*:

![alice's profile on a Pixelfed instance after the *Unfollow*
click; the action button reads *Follow* again, and the followers
counter is back at zero.](./content-sharing/pixelfed-after-unfollow.png)

### Why we do not delete by `actorUri` alone

A subtler design question: why include
`eq(followers.followingId, localUser.id)` in the `WHERE` clause if `actorUri`
is unique to the remote actor?

The answer is that the table's primary key is composite,
`(following_id, actor_uri)`.  In our single-user setup `following_id`
is always `1`, so matching only on `actor_uri` would happen to work,
but the listener is clearer when the `WHERE` clause names the same
two columns that identify the row.  If you ever extend the schema
to host more than one local account, the composite match keeps a
shared remote actor's unfollow against alice from also tearing
down the row representing the same actor following bob.


Followers list and collection
-----------------------------

Look at alice's profile on a fresh Mastodon or Pixelfed tab now —
the *Followers* counter says **0**, even though our database
clearly has at least one follower.  Remote servers do not poke
our SQLite directly; they want to fetch alice's [followers collection], which
is an ActivityPub `OrderedCollection` of every actor following her.  We do not
expose that collection yet.

This chapter adds two complementary pieces in lockstep:

 -  The ActivityPub-side *followers collection dispatcher*, so
    remote servers can ask alice for her follower list and see a
    real number.
 -  An HTML *followers* page on our own site at
    */users/\[username]/followers*, so the local user can
    browse the list in a browser.

Both end up reading the same `followers` table; the only
difference is content negotiation.

[followers collection]: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#followers

### The collection dispatcher

Open *server/federation.ts*.  Pull the `Recipient` type into the
existing `@fedify/vocab` import, and pull `count` and `desc` into
the `drizzle-orm` import:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/federation.ts]
// @noErrors: 2304 2307
import {
  Accept,
  Endpoints,
  Follow,
  getActorHandle,
  Person,
  type Recipient,
  Undo,
} from "@fedify/vocab";
import { and, count, desc, eq } from "drizzle-orm";
~~~~

Then chain a third dispatcher on the `federation` builder, after
the inbox listener block:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/federation.ts]
// @noErrors: 2304 2307 2304 7006
import { type Federation } from "@fedify/fedify";
import { type Recipient } from "@fedify/vocab";
import { count, desc, eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { db } from "./db/client";
import { followers, users } from "./db/schema";
const federation = null as unknown as Federation<void>;
// ---cut-before---
federation
  .setFollowersDispatcher(
    "/users/{identifier}/followers",
    async (_ctx, identifier) => {
      const localUser = (
        await db
          .select()
          .from(users)
          .where(eq(users.username, identifier))
          .limit(1)
      )[0];
      if (localUser === undefined) return null;
      const rows = await db
        .select()
        .from(followers)
        .where(eq(followers.followingId, localUser.id))
        .orderBy(desc(followers.createdAt));
      const items: Recipient[] = rows.map((row) => ({
        id: new URL(row.actorUri),
        inboxId: new URL(row.inboxUrl),
        endpoints:
          row.sharedInboxUrl == null
            ? null
            : { sharedInbox: new URL(row.sharedInboxUrl) },
      }));
      return { items };
    },
  )
  .setCounter(async (_ctx, identifier) => {
    const localUser = (
      await db
        .select()
        .from(users)
        .where(eq(users.username, identifier))
        .limit(1)
    )[0];
    if (localUser === undefined) return 0;
    const result = await db
      .select({ cnt: count() })
      .from(followers)
      .where(eq(followers.followingId, localUser.id));
    return result[0]?.cnt ?? 0;
  });
~~~~

A few notes on the shape:

 -  *The route template.*  `"/users/{identifier}/followers"` is
    parallel to the actor and inbox templates we registered in
    earlier chapters.  Fedify uses the same `{identifier}` to
    cross-reference the dispatcher, so other code can ask for the
    collection's URI via `~Context.getFollowersUri()`.

 -  *Returning `null` for unknown identifiers.*  Just like the
    actor dispatcher, this turns into a `404 Not Found` so we
    never invent a follower list for a username that doesn't exist.

 -  *The [`Recipient`] type.*  Each item we return has the shape
    Fedify uses internally to address remote actors: an `id`, an
    `inboxId`, and an optional `endpoints.sharedInbox`.  Storing
    the inbox URL directly on the row pays off here; we don't
    need a network round trip to compute the response.

 -  *`~CollectionCallbackSetters.setCounter()`.*  Computing
    `count(*)` separately is much cheaper than serializing every
    row, and most clients only render the count in their UI.
    Returning `0` for unknown identifiers is again the safe default.

[`Recipient`]: https://jsr.io/@fedify/vocab/doc/~/Recipient

### Linking the collection from the actor

The dispatcher exists, but alice's `Person` does not yet point at
it.  Add one line to the actor dispatcher's returned `Person`:

~~~~ typescript [server/federation.ts]
return new Person({
  id: ctx.getActorUri(identifier),
  // ... other fields ...
  inbox: ctx.getInboxUri(identifier),
  followers: ctx.getFollowersUri(identifier),
  // ... other fields ...
});
~~~~

`~Context.getFollowersUri()` returns the URL the new dispatcher
serves, computed from the same template Fedify keeps internally.
If we ever change the route template, this call updates with it.

> [!TIP]
> Try `fedify lookup http://localhost:3000/users/alice/followers`.
> You should get an `OrderedCollection` whose `totalItems` matches
> the row count in our `followers` table, and whose `items` array
> holds each remote follower's actor URL.  Remote servers will
> hit the same endpoint and update their cached follower count
> the next time they refresh alice's profile.

### A browser page for the local user

Remote servers are happy with the `OrderedCollection`, but the
local user wants to actually see who's following them.  Move the
existing profile page so it can host a sibling route:

~~~~ sh
mkdir -p app/pages/users/\[username\]
git mv app/pages/users/\[username\].vue app/pages/users/\[username\]/index.vue
~~~~

Now create *app/pages/users/\[username]/followers.vue*:

~~~~ vue [app/pages/users/&#91;username&#93;/followers.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const route = useRoute();
const username = computed(() => String(route.params.username));

const { data, error } = await useFetch(
  () => `/api/users/${username.value}/followers`,
  { key: () => `followers-${username.value}` },
);

if (error.value) {
  throw createError({ statusCode: 404, statusMessage: "User not found" });
}

const user = computed(() => data.value?.user ?? null);
const followers = computed(() => data.value?.followers ?? []);

useHead({
  title: () =>
    user.value
      ? `${user.value.name}'s followers (@${user.value.username})`
      : "PxShare",
});
</script>

<template>
  <section v-if="user" class="flex flex-col gap-6">

        class="text-sm text-gray-500 hover:text-brand"

This page expects a JSON endpoint at
*/api/users/\[username]/followers*.  Add it next to the
existing user endpoint, in *server/api/users/\[username]/followers.get.ts*:

~~~~ typescript [server/api/users/&#91;username&#93;/followers.get.ts]
import { desc, eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { createError, defineEventHandler, getRouterParam } from "h3";
import { db } from "../../../db/client";
import { followers, users } from "../../../db/schema";

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const username = getRouterParam(event, "username");
  if (typeof username !== "string" || username === "") {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 404 });
  }
  const user = (
    await db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.username, username)).limit(1)
  )[0];
  if (user === undefined) {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 404 });
  }
  const rows = await db
    .select()
    .from(followers)
    .where(eq(followers.followingId, user.id))
    .orderBy(desc(followers.createdAt));
  return { user, followers: rows };
});
~~~~

Finally, surface the count on the profile page itself.  Update
*server/api/users/\[username].get.ts* to include `followerCount`:

~~~~ typescript [server/api/users/&#91;username&#93;.get.ts]
import { count, eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { createError, defineEventHandler, getRouterParam } from "h3";
import { db } from "../../db/client";
import { followers, users } from "../../db/schema";

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const username = getRouterParam(event, "username");
  if (typeof username !== "string" || username === "") {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 404 });
  }
  const user = (
    await db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.username, username)).limit(1)
  )[0];
  if (user === undefined) {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 404 });
  }
  const [{ followerCount }] = await db
    .select({ followerCount: count() })
    .from(followers)
    .where(eq(followers.followingId, user.id));
  return { user, followerCount };
});
~~~~

…and rewrite *app/pages/users/\[username]/index.vue* to
render the count as a link to the new page:

~~~~ vue [app/pages/users/&#91;username&#93;/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const route = useRoute();
const username = computed(() => String(route.params.username));

const { data, error } = await useFetch(() => `/api/users/${username.value}`, {
  key: () => `user-${username.value}`,
});

if (error.value) {
  throw createError({ statusCode: 404, statusMessage: "User not found" });
}

const user = computed(() => data.value?.user ?? null);
const followerCount = computed(() => data.value?.followerCount ?? 0);

useHead({

### Trying it out

Visit <http://localhost:3000/users/alice> with at least one
follower in the database.  The profile shows the linked count:

![Alice's profile page after the followers count is wired up.
Below the avatar and handle, a thin navigation row reads
“1 follower” with the number bolded; it is a
link.](./content-sharing/profile-with-follower-count.png)

Click through and you land on the new HTML list:

![Alice's followers page.  A “← Alice Example” back link, the
“Followers” heading, “3 followers”, and three entries: a
Pixelfed account “Tester” (&commat;tester@…), an
ActivityPub.Academy account “Anbelia Doshaelen”, and a Pixelfed
account “洪 民憙 (Hong Minhee)”.  Each follower's handle is
itself a link to their original profile on the remote
server.](./content-sharing/followers-list.png)

Refresh alice's profile on Mastodon or Pixelfed.  Both servers
re-read the `Person`, find the new `followers` URL, fetch the
collection, and start displaying the real follower count.

> [!NOTE]
> If a remote server still shows *0 followers* after a refresh,
> two things help:
>
>  -  Wait for the remote server's actor cache to expire (Mastodon
>     defaults to a few minutes, Pixelfed varies by version).
>  -  Trigger a fresh fetch by following alice from the remote
>     side; the remote server reads the actor JSON afresh and the
>     new `followers` URL goes live.

With our followers list complete, alice can now finally start
producing the *content* her followers signed up for.  The next
chapter introduces the `posts` table that will store image posts.


Image post schema
-----------------

Up to this point alice's account has been a passive shell: it
exists, accepts followers, and otherwise stays silent.  This
chapter lays the groundwork for posts.  We will not let alice
*publish* anything yet (that's
[*Composing and uploading*](#composing-and-uploading)),
but we add the storage layer the next several chapters all build on:
a `posts` table and a directory to hold uploaded images.

### The `posts` table

Open *server/db/schema.ts* and append a new table at the bottom:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/db/schema.ts]
import { sql } from "drizzle-orm";
import { check, integer, sqliteTable, text } from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

export const users = sqliteTable(
  "users",
  {
    id: integer("id").primaryKey({ autoIncrement: false }),
    username: text("username").notNull(),
    name: text("name").notNull(),
    createdAt: text("created_at").notNull().default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`),
  },
  (t) => [check("users_single_user", sql`${t.id} = 1`)],
);
// ---cut---
// Image posts authored by the local user.  One row per post, one
// image per row.  `mediaPath` is a path under *public/uploads/* so
// Nuxt serves the file directly; `mediaType` is the MIME type so
// we can advertise it as `Document.mediaType` in ActivityPub.
// `caption` is the text body shown next to the image; nullable
// because Pixelfed allows captionless posts.
export const posts = sqliteTable("posts", {
  id: integer("id").primaryKey({ autoIncrement: true }),
  userId: integer("user_id")
    .notNull()
    .references(() => users.id),
  caption: text("caption"),
  mediaPath: text("media_path").notNull(),
  mediaType: text("media_type").notNull(),
  createdAt: text("created_at").notNull().default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`),
});

export type Post = typeof posts.$inferSelect;
~~~~

Walking through the columns:

`id`
:   An autoincrementing integer.  This is the post's public
    identifier on our server;
    [*`Note` object dispatcher*](#note-object-dispatcher) weaves it
    into the
    ActivityPub IRI we hand out to other servers.

`userId`
:   Foreign key to `users`.  In our single-user app this is
    always `1` (alice), but naming the author explicitly keeps
    the relationship clear in joins and would generalize without
    schema changes if you ever supported more than one local
    account.

`caption`
:   Optional text body shown next to the image.  Pixelfed allows
    captionless posts, so we keep the column nullable instead of
    forcing a placeholder.

`mediaPath`
:   Relative path under *public/uploads/*, e.g.
    *alice/abc123.jpg*.  Nuxt serves anything under *public/* as
    a static asset, so there is no separate file-serving
    endpoint to write.

`mediaType`
:   MIME type (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`, …).  We hand this
    verbatim to ActivityPub's `Document.mediaType` once
    [*`Note` object dispatcher*](#note-object-dispatcher)
    wires up the Note object dispatcher.

`createdAt`
:   Unix-style created-at timestamp.  Drizzle's
    `` sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` `` default lets SQLite stamp it for
    us; the post composer in
    [*Composing and uploading*](#composing-and-uploading) only
    sets the other
    columns.

Push the schema:

~~~~ sh
npm run db:push
~~~~

> [!NOTE]
> The same “index already exists” warning we saw before re-runs
> idempotently; the new `posts` table is created regardless.

### The uploads directory

Posts are useless without somewhere to store the actual image
bytes.  Nuxt automatically serves anything under *public/* as a
static asset, so we just need to make a directory:

~~~~ sh
mkdir -p public/uploads
touch public/uploads/.gitkeep
~~~~

The empty *.gitkeep* file gives git something to track even when
the folder has no other contents.

We do not want every uploaded image to leak into commits, though.
Update *.gitignore* to exclude the contents of *public/uploads/*
while keeping the *.gitkeep*:

~~~~ gitignore [.gitignore]
# Uploaded image files (the directory is tracked via .gitkeep)
public/uploads/*
!public/uploads/.gitkeep
~~~~

The leading `!` is git's “negate this rule” syntax: the bare
*.gitkeep* sneaks past the wider exclusion.

> [!TIP]
> Production deployments would store uploads on object storage
> (S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO) rather than the local filesystem,
> both for durability and to avoid coupling a single application
> server to its own disk.  We use the local filesystem in the
> tutorial because it is one less dependency and Nuxt makes the
> static path effectively free.  The chapter on production
> deployment in your own future would swap the filesystem path
> for an object-storage URL and adjust the column definition
> accordingly.

That is the entire schema chapter.  No code runs yet; we have set
the stage for the compose form to follow.  The next chapter adds
a *Compose* page, a multipart upload endpoint, and the first
proper insert into the `posts` table.


Composing and uploading
-----------------------

Time to give alice a way to actually post.  We will build two
pieces in lockstep: a form at */compose* and a server endpoint
that accepts the upload.  The combined flow is:

1.  The reader picks a file and a caption in the form.
2.  The browser POSTs the form as `multipart/form-data` to
    */api/posts*.
3.  The endpoint validates the MIME type and size, writes the
    bytes to *public/uploads/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;uuid&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;*,
    inserts a `posts` row, and `303` redirects back to the
    profile.
4.  Nuxt serves the saved file as a static asset under
    */uploads/…* without any extra handler.

### The upload endpoint

Create *server/api/posts.post.ts*:

~~~~ typescript [server/api/posts.post.ts]
import { mkdir, writeFile } from "node:fs/promises";
import path from "node:path";
import {
  createError,
  defineEventHandler,
  readMultipartFormData,
  sendRedirect,
} from "h3";
import { db } from "../db/client";
import { posts } from "../db/schema";
import { getLocalUser } from "../utils/users";

const ALLOWED_TYPES = new Set([
  "image/jpeg",
  "image/png",
  "image/webp",
  "image/gif",
]);
const MAX_BYTES = 8 * 1024 * 1024; // 8 MB

const EXTENSION: Record<string, string> = {
  "image/jpeg": "jpg",
  "image/png": "png",
  "image/webp": "webp",
  "image/gif": "gif",
};

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const user = await getLocalUser();
  if (user == null) {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 403, statusMessage: "No user" });
  }

  const parts = await readMultipartFormData(event);
  if (parts == null) {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 400, statusMessage: "Empty body" });
  }

  let caption: string | null = null;
  let imageBuffer: Buffer | null = null;
  let imageType: string | null = null;
  for (const part of parts) {
    if (part.name === "caption") {
      const text = part.data.toString("utf8").trim();
      caption = text === "" ? null : text;
    } else if (part.name === "image") {
      imageBuffer = part.data;
      imageType = part.type ?? null;
    }
  }

  if (imageBuffer == null || imageType == null) {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 400, statusMessage: "Missing image" });
  }
  if (!ALLOWED_TYPES.has(imageType)) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 415,
      statusMessage: `Unsupported media type: ${imageType}`,
    });
  }
  if (imageBuffer.byteLength > MAX_BYTES) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 413,
      statusMessage: `Image too large (max ${MAX_BYTES / 1024 / 1024} MB)`,
    });
  }

  const ext = EXTENSION[imageType];
  const filename = `${crypto.randomUUID()}.${ext}`;
  const userDir = path.join("public", "uploads", user.username);
  await mkdir(userDir, { recursive: true });
  await writeFile(path.join(userDir, filename), imageBuffer);

  const mediaPath = `${user.username}/${filename}`;
  await db.insert(posts).values({
    userId: user.id,
    caption,
    mediaPath,
    mediaType: imageType,
  });

  return await sendRedirect(event, `/users/${user.username}`, 303);
});
~~~~

Walking through:

`readMultipartFormData(event)`
:   h3 has a built-in multipart parser; no extra dependency.  We
    iterate the parts once and pick out the caption and image by
    name instead of trusting the order the browser uses.

`ALLOWED_TYPES`, `MAX_BYTES`
:   Only JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF go through, capped at 8 MB.
    Anything else fails fast with a meaningful HTTP status; the
    browser shows the message in the form's default error UI.

*Filename generation*
:   `crypto.randomUUID()` plus the extension we pick for the MIME
    type.  Random UUIDs avoid both clashes and the security
    concern of accepting filenames from user input.

*`303 See Other`*
:   This is the right HTTP status for “the POST succeeded; come
    fetch the next page with a `GET`.”  Browsers follow it
    automatically, and the form pattern works without any
    client-side JS.

> [!TIP]
> Real Pixelfed instances run uploaded images through a
> thumbnailing pipeline (sharp/libvips) so the in-feed image is
> a sensible size and the original lives only on the post detail
> page.  We deliberately ship the original byte-for-byte: the
> dependency surface stays small, Nuxt's *public/* pipeline
> streams the file as-is, and the closing chapter lists
> thumbnailing as a natural next step.

### The compose page

Create *app/pages/compose.vue*:

~~~~ vue [app/pages/compose.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { data } = await useFetch("/api/me", { key: "me-compose" });
const meUsername = computed(() => data.value?.user?.username ?? "");

useHead({ title: "Compose · PxShare" });
</script>

<template>
  <section class="flex flex-col gap-4">
    <header>
      <h1 class="text-xl font-bold">New post</h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">
        Pick an image, add a caption, and share it with your followers.
      </p>
    </header>
    <form
      action="/api/posts"
      method="post"
      enctype="multipart/form-data"
      class="flex flex-col gap-4"
    >
      <label class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <span class="text-sm font-semibold">Image</span>
        <input
          type="file"
          name="image"
          accept="image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp,image/gif"
          required
          class="block w-full text-sm file:mr-4 file:py-2 file:px-4 file:rounded-full file:border-0 file:bg-brand/10 file:text-brand file:font-semibold hover:file:bg-brand/20 cursor-pointer"
        />
        <span class="text-xs text-gray-500">
          JPEG, PNG, WebP, or GIF.  Up to 8 MB.
        </span>
      </label>
      <label class="flex flex-col gap-1">
        <span class="text-sm font-semibold">Caption</span>
        <textarea
          name="caption"
          rows="3"
          maxlength="500"
          placeholder="Say something about this picture (optional)"
          class="border border-gray-300 rounded-lg p-2 text-sm focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-brand/40"
        ></textarea>
      </label>
      <div class="flex items-center justify-end gap-3">
        <NuxtLink
          v-if="meUsername"
          :to="`/users/${meUsername}`"
          class="text-sm text-gray-500 hover:text-brand"
        >
          Cancel
        </NuxtLink>
        <button
          type="submit"
          class="px-4 py-2 bg-brand text-white rounded-full text-sm font-semibold hover:bg-brand-dark"
        >
          Post
        </button>
      </div>
    </form>
  </section>
</template>
~~~~

The `Compose` button in *app.vue* already points at */compose*,
so the new page is reachable from anywhere.  The `<form>` POSTs
straight to */api/posts* with `enctype="multipart/form-data"`,
which is the only required ingredient for browsers to upload
binary data without JavaScript.

### Trying it out

Open <http://localhost:3000/compose> and you should see:

![PxShare compose page.  An *Image* file picker, an empty
*Caption* textarea, and a pink *Post* button on the
right.](./content-sharing/compose-form.png)

Pick any small image, add a caption, and click *Post*.  The
browser follows the `303` redirect back to alice's profile.
The post itself does not show on the profile yet;
[*Profile feed*](#profile-feed)
adds the grid of posts that pulls from the new table.  But you
can confirm the row was written:

~~~~ sh
sqlite3 -header -column content-sharing.sqlite3 "SELECT * FROM posts"
~~~~

| `id` | `user_id` | `caption`               | `media_path`                                     | `media_type` | `created_at`          |
| ---- | --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | --------------------- |
| `1`  | `1`       | `Hello from chapter 14` | `alice/5a1d45d6-74f6-48fe-a578-ed33e62d478b.png` | `image/png`  | `2026-04-26 01:23:43` |

…and the file lives where we asked Nuxt to serve it:

~~~~ sh
curl -I "http://localhost:3000/uploads/alice/5a1d45d6-74f6-48fe-a578-ed33e62d478b.png"
~~~~

~~~~ console
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: image/png
Content-Length: ...
~~~~

The next chapter teaches Fedify to serve those rows as
ActivityPub `Note` objects so other servers can fetch them.


`Note` object dispatcher
------------------------

We have rows in `posts` and a way to add new ones, but other
servers cannot see them yet.  An ActivityPub post is a [`Note`]
object with at least an `id`, an `attributedTo` actor, and some
content.  Image posts also carry a [`Document`] attachment.
Fedify's `~Federatable.setObjectDispatcher()` lets us declare a
URL template, give it a typed callback, and have all the routing
and content negotiation handled for us.

[`Note`]: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-note
[`Document`]: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-document

### Adding the dispatcher

Open *server/federation.ts*.  Add `Document`, `Note`, and
`PUBLIC_COLLECTION` to the `@fedify/vocab` import, pull in the
`Temporal` polyfill, and add `posts` to the schema import:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/federation.ts]
// @noErrors: 2304 2307 2322
import {
  Accept,
  Document,
  Endpoints,
  Follow,
  getActorHandle,
  Note,
  Person,
  PUBLIC_COLLECTION,
  type Recipient,
  Undo,
} from "@fedify/vocab";
import { Temporal } from "temporal-polyfill";
// ...
import { actorKeys, followers, posts, users } from "./db/schema";
~~~~

We also need the polyfill itself in *package.json*:

~~~~ sh
npm install temporal-polyfill
~~~~

Node.js 22 does not yet ship `Temporal` natively, and Fedify
uses `Temporal.Instant` for ActivityPub timestamps; the polyfill
bridges the gap.

> [!NOTE]
> Once Node.js ships [`Temporal`] natively (currently behind a
> flag in 22.x and slated to be on by default in a near-term
> release), the polyfill goes away.  Fedify keeps using
> `Temporal.Instant` regardless, so this is the only line that
> needs to change.

Then add a final dispatcher block after the followers dispatcher:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/federation.ts]
// @noErrors: 2304 2307 7006
import { type Federation } from "@fedify/fedify";
import { Document, Note, PUBLIC_COLLECTION } from "@fedify/vocab";
import { and, eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { db } from "./db/client";
import { posts, users } from "./db/schema";
const federation = null as unknown as Federation<void>;
// ---cut-before---
federation.setObjectDispatcher(
  Note,
  "/users/{identifier}/posts/{id}",
  async (ctx, { identifier, id }) => {
    const postId = Number(id);
    if (!Number.isInteger(postId) || postId < 1) return null;
    const localUser = (
      await db
        .select()
        .from(users)
        .where(eq(users.username, identifier))
        .limit(1)
    )[0];
    if (localUser === undefined) return null;
    const post = (
      await db
        .select()
        .from(posts)
        .where(and(eq(posts.id, postId), eq(posts.userId, localUser.id)))
        .limit(1)
    )[0];
    if (post === undefined) return null;

    const mediaUrl = new URL(`/uploads/${post.mediaPath}`, ctx.canonicalOrigin);
    const noteId = ctx.getObjectUri(Note, { identifier, id });
    return new Note({
      id: noteId,
      attribution: ctx.getActorUri(identifier),
      to: PUBLIC_COLLECTION,
      cc: ctx.getFollowersUri(identifier),
      url: noteId,
      content: post.caption ?? "",
      published: Temporal.Instant.from(
        `${post.createdAt.replace(" ", "T")}Z`,
      ),
      // Always emit `attachments` as an array; some peers (notably

        new Document({

        }),
      ],
    });
  },

Walking through the listener:

`ctx.getObjectUri(Note, { identifier, id })`
:   Mints the canonical URI from the same template we registered
    the dispatcher with.  Using the helper instead of building a
    URL ourselves means the URI updates if we ever change the
    template.

`Number.isInteger(postId)`
:   Belt and suspenders: the route template only matches strings,
    but integer-shaped strings like `"1.2"` would still slip
    through.  We normalize and reject anything that is not a
    positive integer.

*The `userId` filter*
:   Even though only one local user exists today, we constrain
    the lookup to `posts.userId = localUser.id` so a future
    multi-user instance cannot have one user serve another's
    posts.

`to: PUBLIC_COLLECTION`, `cc: ctx.getFollowersUri(identifier)`
:   Public posts are addressed to the magic
    `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public` URI on `to`,
    plus the followers collection on `cc`.  Mastodon and Pixelfed
    both render this as a “public” post; either field alone is
    less consistent.

`published: Temporal.Instant.from(...)`
:   SQLite stores `2026-04-26 01:23:43`, which is not an ISO 8601
    instant.  The dance with `replace(" ", "T")` and a trailing
    `Z` turns it into one before we hand it to Temporal.

`attachments: [...]`
:   *Always* an array, even for a single attachment.  Pixelfed in
    particular treats a scalar Document as a different shape and
    silently ignores it; emitting an array keeps interop
    predictable.  See [PR #721] for the upstream wrapper that
    catches this for activities, but writing it idiomatically here
    saves us from depending on it.

[PR #721]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/pull/721

### Looking the post up

With the dev server restarted, ask Fedify to look up the post you
created in the previous chapter:

~~~~ sh
fedify lookup http://localhost:3000/users/alice/posts/1
~~~~

~~~~ console
✔ Fetched object: http://localhost:3000/users/alice/posts/1
Note {
  id: URL 'http://localhost:3000/users/alice/posts/1',
  attachments: [
    Document {
      url: URL 'http://localhost:3000/uploads/alice/<uuid>.png',
      mediaType: 'image/png'
    }
  ],
  attribution: URL 'http://localhost:3000/users/alice',
  content: 'Hello from chapter 14',
  published: Instant [Temporal.Instant] {},
  url: URL 'http://localhost:3000/users/alice/posts/1',
  to: URL 'https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public',
  cc: URL 'http://localhost:3000/users/alice/followers'
}
~~~~

The attached `Document` lives at the same URL Nuxt serves the
file from, so any peer that fetches this Note can also fetch the
image directly.

Posts are now individually addressable, but alice's profile page
still says “No posts yet”.  The next chapter renders posts in a
grid on the profile.


Profile feed
------------

Alice now has posts she can author and Notes other servers can
fetch, but her own profile page is still stuck on “No posts yet.”
This chapter renders the feed.

### A JSON endpoint for the posts list

Create *server/api/users/\[username]/posts.get.ts*:

~~~~ typescript [server/api/users/&#91;username&#93;/posts.get.ts]
import { desc, eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { createError, defineEventHandler, getRouterParam } from "h3";
import { db } from "../../../db/client";
import { posts, users } from "../../../db/schema";

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const username = getRouterParam(event, "username");
  if (typeof username !== "string" || username === "") {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 404 });
  }
  const user = (
    await db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.username, username)).limit(1)
  )[0];
  if (user === undefined) {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 404 });
  }
  const rows = await db
    .select()
    .from(posts)
    .where(eq(posts.userId, user.id))
    .orderBy(desc(posts.createdAt));
  return { user, posts: rows };
});
~~~~

The endpoint mirrors the followers one from
[*Followers list and collection*](#followers-list-and-collection):
validate
the username, resolve the user, return everything ordered
newest-first.  Real Pixelfed instances paginate this; we will
revisit pagination in the closing chapter under “areas for
improvement.”

### Surfacing the post count

Open *server/api/users/\[username].get.ts* and add a
matching `postCount` aggregate to the existing profile payload:

~~~~ typescript [server/api/users/&#91;username&#93;.get.ts]
import { count, eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { createError, defineEventHandler, getRouterParam } from "h3";
import { db } from "../../db/client";
import { followers, posts, users } from "../../db/schema";

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const username = getRouterParam(event, "username");
  if (typeof username !== "string" || username === "") {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 404 });
  }
  const user = (
    await db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.username, username)).limit(1)
  )[0];
  if (user === undefined) {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 404 });
  }
  const [{ followerCount }] = await db
    .select({ followerCount: count() })
    .from(followers)
    .where(eq(followers.followingId, user.id));
  const [{ postCount }] = await db
    .select({ postCount: count() })
    .from(posts)
    .where(eq(posts.userId, user.id));
  return { user, followerCount, postCount };
});
~~~~

### The grid on the profile page

Rewrite *app/pages/users/\[username]/index.vue* to fetch
both endpoints in parallel and render the post grid:

~~~~ vue [app/pages/users/&#91;username&#93;/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const route = useRoute();
const username = computed(() => String(route.params.username));

const { data: profile, error } = await useFetch(
  () => `/api/users/${username.value}`,
  { key: () => `user-${username.value}` },
);

if (error.value) {
  throw createError({ statusCode: 404, statusMessage: "User not found" });
}

const { data: postsData } = await useFetch(
  () => `/api/users/${username.value}/posts`,
  { key: () => `posts-${username.value}` },
);

const user = computed(() => profile.value?.user ?? null);
const followerCount = computed(() => profile.value?.followerCount ?? 0);
const postCount = computed(() => profile.value?.postCount ?? 0);
const posts = computed(() => postsData.value?.posts ?? []);

useHead({
  title: () =>
    user.value ? `${user.value.name} (@${user.value.username})` : "PxShare",
});
</script>

<template>
  <section v-if="user" class="flex flex-col gap-6">
    <header class="flex items-center gap-4">
      <div
        class="w-20 h-20 rounded-full bg-brand/10 flex items-center justify-center text-3xl font-bold text-brand"
      >
        {{ user.name[0] }}
      </div>
      <div class="flex flex-col">
        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold">{{ user.name }}</h1>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">@{{ user.username }}</p>
      </div>
    </header>
    <nav class="flex gap-6 text-sm border-b border-gray-200 pb-3">
      <span>
        <strong>{{ postCount }}</strong>
        {{ postCount === 1 ? "post" : "posts" }}
      </span>
      <NuxtLink
        :to="`/users/${user.username}/followers`"
        class="hover:text-brand"
      >
        <strong>{{ followerCount }}</strong>
        {{ followerCount === 1 ? "follower" : "followers" }}
      </NuxtLink>
    </nav>
    <div v-if="posts.length > 0" class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-1">
      <NuxtLink
        v-for="post in posts"
        :key="post.id"
        :to="`/users/${user.username}/posts/${post.id}`"
        class="block aspect-square overflow-hidden bg-gray-100 hover:opacity-90 transition"
      >
        <img
          :src="`/uploads/${post.mediaPath}`"
          :alt="post.caption ?? ''"
          class="w-full h-full object-cover"
        />
      </NuxtLink>
    </div>
    <p v-else class="text-sm text-gray-400 py-8 text-center">No posts yet.</p>
  </section>
</template>
~~~~

The grid is three columns of square tiles, the same shape Pixelfed
uses on its profile pages.  Each tile is a `NuxtLink` pointing at
*/users/&lt;username&gt;/posts/&lt;id&gt;*; the route the next
chapter will fill in.  `object-cover` crops images that are not
square so they fill the tile cleanly.

### Trying it out

Refresh <http://localhost:3000/users/alice>.  Now the counter row
shows the post count, and the grid renders a tile per row in
`posts`:

![Alice's profile with the post count and a grid of square thumbnails.](./content-sharing/profile-feed.png)

The counters and grid update on every page load; there is no
caching layer beyond the database itself, so freshly composed
posts appear on the next refresh.

The next chapter wires up the post detail route the tiles already
link to, so clicking a tile leads somewhere instead of 404ing.


Post detail page
----------------

The grid tiles from [*Profile feed*](#profile-feed) link at
*/users/&lt;username&gt;/posts/&lt;id&gt;* but that route does
not exist yet.  This chapter adds the page that goes there: a
single image at full bleed, the caption, a timestamp, and the
Open Graph metadata that turns the URL into a rich preview when
it is shared.

### A JSON endpoint for one post

Create
*server/api/users/\[username]/posts/\[id].get.ts*:

~~~~ typescript [server/api/users/&#91;username&#93;/posts/&#91;id&#93;.get.ts]
import { and, eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { createError, defineEventHandler, getRouterParam } from "h3";
import { db } from "../../../../db/client";
import { posts, users } from "../../../../db/schema";

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const username = getRouterParam(event, "username");
  const idParam = getRouterParam(event, "id");
  if (typeof username !== "string" || username === "") {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 404 });
  }
  const id = Number(idParam);
  if (!Number.isInteger(id) || id < 1) {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 404 });
  }
  const user = (
    await db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.username, username)).limit(1)
  )[0];
  if (user === undefined) {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 404 });
  }
  const post = (
    await db
      .select()
      .from(posts)
      .where(and(eq(posts.id, id), eq(posts.userId, user.id)))
      .limit(1)
  )[0];
  if (post === undefined) {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 404 });
  }
  return { user, post };
});
~~~~

The endpoint validates both pieces of the URL (username + integer
id) and constrains the lookup with both columns.  That makes
*/users/alice/posts/2* a 404 if post id 2 actually belongs to
*bob*; the URL stays canonical even if the schema later opens up
to multiple local users.

### The Vue page

Create
*app/pages/users/\[username]/posts/\[id].vue*:

~~~~ vue [app/pages/users/&#91;username&#93;/posts/&#91;id&#93;.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const route = useRoute();
const username = computed(() => String(route.params.username));
const postId = computed(() => String(route.params.id));

const { data, error } = await useFetch(
  () => `/api/users/${username.value}/posts/${postId.value}`,
  { key: () => `post-${username.value}-${postId.value}` },
);

if (error.value) {
  throw createError({ statusCode: 404, statusMessage: "Post not found" });
}

const user = computed(() => data.value?.user ?? null);
const post = computed(() => data.value?.post ?? null);
const imageUrl = computed(() =>
  post.value ? `/uploads/${post.value.mediaPath}` : "",
);
const headline = computed(() =>
  user.value && post.value
    ? post.value.caption
      ? `${user.value.name}: ${post.value.caption}`
      : `Post by ${user.value.name}`
    : "PxShare",
);

useHead({
  title: () => headline.value,
  meta: () => [
    { property: "og:title", content: headline.value },
    { property: "og:type", content: "article" },
    { property: "og:image", content: imageUrl.value },
    {
      property: "og:description",
      content: post.value?.caption ?? "Posted on PxShare",
    },
  ],
});
</script>

<template>
  <article v-if="user && post" class="flex flex-col gap-4">
    <NuxtLink
      :to="`/users/${user.username}`"
      class="text-sm text-gray-500 hover:text-brand"
    >
      ← {{ user.name }}
    </NuxtLink>
    <figure
      class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg overflow-hidden flex items-center justify-center"
    >
      <img
        :src="imageUrl"
        :alt="post.caption ?? ''"
        class="w-full max-h-[80vh] object-contain"
      />
    </figure>
    <p v-if="post.caption" class="text-base whitespace-pre-line">
      {{ post.caption }}
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs text-gray-400">
      Posted {{ new Date(post.createdAt + "Z").toLocaleString() }}
    </p>
  </article>
</template>
~~~~

A few details worth calling out:

`max-h-[80vh] object-contain`
:   Wide-aspect images get the full viewport width; portrait
    images do not blow past 80% of the viewport height.  The
    container's gray rectangle fills the rest, giving every
    post a consistent visual weight regardless of orientation.

*Open Graph metadata*
:   When somebody pastes the post URL into Slack, Mastodon, or
    any rich-link target, the embed shows the image and caption
    instead of just the URL.  `og:image` points at the same
    static-asset path Nuxt already serves; no separate preview
    pipeline.

*Locale-aware timestamp*
:   `new Date(post.createdAt + "Z").toLocaleString()` parses the
    SQLite string as UTC and formats it in the visitor's locale.
    The closing chapter's “areas for improvement” lists relative
    timestamps as a natural extension.

### Trying it out

Click any post tile from the profile.  The detail page renders
the image, the caption, and the timestamp:

![Post detail page for a sample image, with the image filling the
content column and a caption beneath it.](./content-sharing/post-detail.png)

The image still has the original dimensions we uploaded; the
container handles the layout.  The next chapter teaches alice to
*push* posts: when she composes one, our server sends a
`Create(Note)` to every follower's inbox so the post lands in
their home timeline.


Distributing new posts to followers
-----------------------------------

So far alice can post, and other servers can fetch each post
through the object dispatcher.  But fetching is *pull*, and
nothing makes a remote follower notice a new post unless they
think to refetch alice's profile.  Federation needs *push*:
whenever alice composes, we should send a `Create(Note)`
activity to every follower's inbox so the post lands in their
home timeline straight away.

This is the moment the rest of the fediverse stops being a
curiosity and starts being a place: alice's friends on Mastodon
or Pixelfed see her photos in their feeds without ever knowing
PxShare exists.

### Refactor: a reusable `buildNote`

The Note we construct inside `~Federatable.setObjectDispatcher()`
in [*`Note` object dispatcher*](#note-object-dispatcher) is
exactly what we want to wrap in a `Create`
when alice composes.  Pull that body into a small helper so the
two callers share one definition.

Open *server/federation.ts* and add the helper just above the
existing object-dispatcher block:

~~~~ typescript [server/federation.ts]
import type { Context } from "@fedify/fedify";
// …existing imports…
import {
  Accept,
  Create,
  Document,
  // …
} from "@fedify/vocab";

// …actor / followers / inbox setup unchanged…

// Build a Note for a stored post.  Shared by the object
// dispatcher (so other servers can fetch a single post) and the
// compose endpoint (so we can wrap the Note in a Create activity
// and fan it out to followers).
export function buildNote(
  ctx: Context<unknown>,
  identifier: string,
  post: {
    id: number;
    caption: string | null;
    mediaPath: string;
    mediaType: string;
    createdAt: string;
  },
): Note {
  const noteId = ctx.getObjectUri(Note, {
    identifier,
    id: String(post.id),
  });
  return new Note({
    id: noteId,
    attribution: ctx.getActorUri(identifier),
    to: PUBLIC_COLLECTION,
    cc: ctx.getFollowersUri(identifier),
    url: noteId,
    content: post.caption ?? "",
    published: Temporal.Instant.from(`${post.createdAt.replace(" ", "T")}Z`),
    attachments: [
      new Document({
        mediaType: post.mediaType,
        url: new URL(`/uploads/${post.mediaPath}`, ctx.canonicalOrigin),
      }),
    ],
  });
}
~~~~

Then collapse the `setObjectDispatcher()` body to delegate to
the helper:

~~~~ typescript [server/federation.ts]
federation.setObjectDispatcher(
  Note,
  "/users/{identifier}/posts/{id}",
  async (ctx, { identifier, id }) => {
    const postId = Number(id);
    if (!Number.isInteger(postId) || postId < 1) return null;
    const localUser = (
      await db
        .select()
        .from(users)
        .where(eq(users.username, identifier))
        .limit(1)
    )[0];
    if (localUser === undefined) return null;
    const post = (
      await db
        .select()
        .from(posts)
        .where(and(eq(posts.id, postId), eq(posts.userId, localUser.id)))
        .limit(1)
    )[0];
    if (post === undefined) return null;
    return buildNote(ctx, identifier, post);
  },
);
~~~~

> [!TIP]
> Why drop a typed `Context<unknown>` in here?
> `~Federatable.setObjectDispatcher()` already gives the dispatcher callback a
> `Context` whose `contextData` is the federation's context-data type
> (we have not customized it, so it is `unknown`).  The compose endpoint will
> obtain the same `Context` from `federation.createContext()`, and
> that returns a `Context` of the same shape.  Typing the parameter once lets
> both callers feed in their own `Context` without copy-pasting generic
> parameters.

### Send `Create(Note)` from the compose endpoint

Now hook the fan-out into *server/api/posts.post.ts*.  We want
to:

1.  Insert the row (already done) but capture the inserted record
    so we know its id and timestamp without an extra read.
2.  Build a Note from that record using `buildNote`.
3.  Wrap the Note in a `Create` activity.
4.  Hand the activity to Fedify with the magic recipient
    `"followers"` so it expands into every follower's inbox.

Open *server/api/posts.post.ts* and update the imports plus the
section after the file write:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/api/posts.post.ts]
// @noErrors: 2304 2307 2552 18004
import { mkdir, writeFile } from "node:fs/promises";

import {

  sendRedirect,
  toWebRequest, // [!code ++]
} from "h3";
import { db } from "../db/client";
import { posts } from "../db/schema";
import federation, { buildNote } from "../federation"; // [!code ++]
import { getLocalUser } from "../utils/users";

// …ALLOWED_TYPES, MAX_BYTES, EXTENSION unchanged…

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  // …auth, multipart parsing, validation, and writeFile() unchanged…

  const mediaPath = `${user.username}/${filename}`;
  const [inserted] = await db // [!code ++]
    .insert(posts)
    .values({
      userId: user.id,
      caption,
      mediaPath,
      mediaType: imageType,
    })
    .returning(); // [!code ++]

  // Fan out a Create(Note) to every follower's inbox.  Fedify // [!code ++]
  // expands the magic "followers" target into the right inbox or // [!code ++]
  // sharedInbox URLs and queues the deliveries through the // [!code ++]
  // message queue, so the request returns quickly even for big // [!code ++]
  // follower lists. // [!code ++]
  const ctx = federation.createContext(toWebRequest(event), undefined); // [!code ++]
  const note = buildNote(ctx, user.username, inserted); // [!code ++]
  await ctx.sendActivity( // [!code ++]
    { identifier: user.username }, // [!code ++]
    "followers", // [!code ++]
    new Create({ // [!code ++]
      id: new URL("#create", note.id ?? ""), // [!code ++]
      actor: ctx.getActorUri(user.username), // [!code ++]
      to: note.toIds[0] ?? null, // [!code ++]
      cc: note.ccIds[0] ?? null, // [!code ++]
      object: note, // [!code ++]
      published: note.published, // [!code ++]
    }), // [!code ++]
  ); // [!code ++]

  return await sendRedirect(event, `/users/${user.username}`, 303);
});
~~~~

Three details worth pausing on:

`.returning()` *(Drizzle)*
:   Drizzle's SQLite driver supports SQL's `RETURNING` clause,
    which gives us back the row exactly as it was written, with
    the auto-incremented `id` and the database-generated
    `createdAt`.  Without it we would have to re-`SELECT` after
    the insert.

`federation.createContext()`
:   Inbox listeners and dispatchers receive a `Context` for free.
    Anywhere else, including a route handler outside Fedify's
    own routes, we ask the federation for one.  `~Federation.createContext()`
    needs the request so it can resolve the canonical origin from
    the *Host* and *X-Forwarded-Host* headers.  The second
    argument is the per-request context data; we passed
    `undefined` because PxShare does not use a context-data
    payload.

`"followers"` *as a sendActivity recipient*
:   Fedify recognizes this magic string and consults the followers
    dispatcher we wrote in
    [*Followers list and collection*](#followers-list-and-collection).
    It walks the result,
    deduplicates by shared-inbox URL where one is advertised, and
    queues a delivery for each unique endpoint.  The compose
    request returns immediately; the actual HTTP POSTs happen in
    the message queue worker, signed with alice's keys.

> [!NOTE]
> The `to`/`cc` fields on the `Create` repeat the Note's
> recipients.  Some peers (most notably Mastodon) read the

### Trying it out

Make sure a Pixelfed account is following alice first; chapter
10 covered the round trip end-to-end.  With a follower in place,
restart the dev server, open the *Compose* form on the tunnel
URL (so the canonical origin in the activity matches the keys
alice signs with), pick an image, write a caption, and hit
*Post*.

The dev server logs the delivery the moment Fedify drains the
queue:

~~~~ ansi [terminal]
ℹ INF fedify·federation·outbox Successfully sent activity
  'https://your-tunnel.example/users/alice/posts/7#create'
  to 'https://your-pixelfed.example/users/tester/inbox'.
~~~~

Refresh the Pixelfed account's *Home Feed*: alice's image lands
on the feed straight away, captioned and ready to like:

![Pixelfed's home feed rendering alice's foggy beach photo
under her handle, with the caption “Pixelfed federation debug
post.” beneath the
image.](./content-sharing/pixelfed-home-with-alice-post.png)

This is the round trip the whole tutorial has been pointing at:
alice composes locally, the fediverse sees it within a second,
and Pixelfed renders it as a first-class post inside its own
feed.  Mastodon and GoToSocial accept the same activity and
behave the same way.

> [!TIP]

Once Pixelfed shows the post, the federation loop is real:
alice posts, the fediverse sees it.  The next chapter teaches
alice to follow *back*: discovering remote actors, sending a
`Follow`, and handling the `Accept` that completes the
relationship.


Following remote accounts
-------------------------

Federation has been one-directional so far: remote servers can
follow alice, but alice cannot follow them.  This chapter closes
the loop.  By the end alice will be able to paste a fediverse
handle into a form and end up with a recorded relationship that
remote `Create(Note)` activities can address as inbox.

### A `following` table

Mirror the *followers* table from
[*Handling follows*](#handling-follows), with two new
columns:

`status`
:   either `"pending"` (the moment we send the `Follow`) or
    `"accepted"` (after the remote server confirms).  Showing
    the relationship as pending until the `Accept` arrives
    matches what Mastodon's own UI does for the same case, and
    avoids surprising alice if the remote server drops the
    request.

`followActivityId`
:   the `id` we put on the outbound `Follow`.  Most peers echo
    this back as the embedded object of `Accept`, which gives
    us a precise match when several pending follows are in
    flight at once.

Append the table to *server/db/schema.ts*:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/db/schema.ts]
import { sql } from "drizzle-orm";
import {
  check,
  integer,
  primaryKey,
  sqliteTable,
  text,
} from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

export const users = sqliteTable(
  "users",
  {
    id: integer("id").primaryKey({ autoIncrement: false }),
    username: text("username").notNull(),
    name: text("name").notNull(),
    createdAt: text("created_at").notNull().default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`),
  },
  (t) => [check("users_single_user", sql`${t.id} = 1`)],
);
// ---cut---
export const following = sqliteTable(
  "following",
  {
    followerId: integer("follower_id")
      .notNull()
      .references(() => users.id),
    actorUri: text("actor_uri").notNull(),
    handle: text("handle").notNull(),
    name: text("name"),
    inboxUrl: text("inbox_url").notNull(),
    sharedInboxUrl: text("shared_inbox_url"),
    url: text("url"),
    status: text("status", { enum: ["pending", "accepted"] })
      .notNull()
      .default("pending"),
    followActivityId: text("follow_activity_id").notNull(),
    createdAt: text("created_at").notNull().default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`),
  },
  (t) => [primaryKey({ columns: [t.followerId, t.actorUri] })],
);

export type Following = typeof following.$inferSelect;

### The `/follow` page

Create *app/pages/follow.vue*.  It is a thin form on top of
`$fetch`, with a result paragraph that flips between idle,
loading, success, and error.

~~~~ vue [app/pages/follow.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { data: me } = await useFetch("/api/me", { key: "me-follow" });
const meUsername = computed(() => me.value?.user?.username ?? "");

const handle = ref("");
const status = ref<"idle" | "loading" | "success" | "error">("idle");
const message = ref("");

async function submit() {
  if (handle.value.trim() === "") return;
  status.value = "loading";
  message.value = "";
  try {
    const result = await $fetch<{ handle: string }>("/api/follow", {
      method: "POST",
      body: { handle: handle.value.trim() },
    });
    status.value = "success";
    message.value = `Sent a Follow to ${result.handle}.  It will move to "accepted" once the remote server confirms.`;
    handle.value = "";
  } catch (error) {
    status.value = "error";
    const fetchError = error as { statusMessage?: string; message?: string };
    message.value =
      fetchError.statusMessage ?? fetchError.message ?? "Follow failed.";
  }
}

useHead({ title: "Follow someone · PxShare" });
</script>

<template>
  <section class="flex flex-col gap-4">

The empty form looks like:

![The Follow page with an empty input box, placeholder “&commat;dahlia&commat;hollo.social or https://mastodon.social/&commat;gargron”, and a Follow button on the right.](./content-sharing/follow-page-empty.png)

Add a quick *Follow* link to the navbar in *app/app.vue* so the
page is reachable without typing the URL:

<nav class="flex items-center gap-4 text-sm">
  <NuxtLink to="/follow" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-brand">

    Compose
  </NuxtLink>
</nav>

### The follow endpoint

Create *server/api/follow.post.ts*:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/api/follow.post.ts]
// @noErrors: 2304 2307
import { Follow, getActorHandle, isActor } from "@fedify/vocab";
import {
  createError,

import { getLocalUser } from "../utils/users";

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const user = await getLocalUser();
  if (user == null) {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 403, statusMessage: "No user" });
  }

  const body = await readBody<{ handle?: unknown }>(event);
  const handle = typeof body?.handle === "string" ? body.handle.trim() : "";
  if (handle === "") {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 400, statusMessage: "Missing handle" });
  }

  const ctx = federation.createContext(toWebRequest(event), undefined);
  const actor = await ctx.lookupObject(handle, {
    documentLoader: await ctx.getDocumentLoader({ identifier: user.username }),
  });
  if (actor == null || !isActor(actor)) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 404,
      statusMessage: `Could not resolve actor: ${handle}`,
    });
  }
  if (actor.id == null || actor.inboxId == null) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 422,
      statusMessage: "Resolved actor lacks an id or inbox",
    });
  }

  const followActivityId = new URL(
    `#follows/${crypto.randomUUID()}`,
    ctx.getActorUri(user.username),
  );
  const remoteHandle = await getActorHandle(actor);
  await db
    .insert(following)
    .values({
      followerId: user.id,
      actorUri: actor.id.href,
      handle: remoteHandle,
      name: actor.name?.toString() ?? null,
      inboxUrl: actor.inboxId.href,
      sharedInboxUrl: actor.endpoints?.sharedInbox?.href ?? null,
      url: actor.url?.href ?? null,
      status: "pending",
      followActivityId: followActivityId.href,
    })
    .onConflictDoNothing();

  await ctx.sendActivity(
    { identifier: user.username },
    actor,
    new Follow({
      id: followActivityId,
      actor: ctx.getActorUri(user.username),
      object: actor.id,
    }),
  );

  return {
    handle: remoteHandle,
    actorUri: actor.id.href,
    status: "pending" as const,
  };
});
~~~~

The interesting bits:

`ctx.lookupObject()`
:   accepts whatever shape the user typed.  An *@user@server*
    handle triggers a WebFinger request (resolves to an
    `acct:` URI, then to a profile URL); a profile URL is
    fetched directly.  Pass `documentLoader` so the fetch is
    signed with alice's keys, which lets *authorized-fetch*
    instances (notably Mastodon with secure mode on) answer the
    request.

`isActor()`
:   filters the result down to
    `Application | Group | Organization | Person | Service`. Anything else (a
    stray `Note` or `Image`) gets a 404 instead of crashing later.

`onConflictDoNothing()`
:   makes following the same account twice a safe no-op.  We
    keep the existing row's status because we may already have
    been accepted, and re-sending a `Follow` is harmless from
    the peer's perspective anyway.

`new Follow({ id: …, actor: …, object: … })`
:   the bare minimum.  The `id` is what the remote server is
    expected to embed back into the `Accept`'s `object` field
    so we can match the response to the right row.

### Accept inbox listener

Add `Accept` (alongside the existing `Follow`) to the
[`@fedify/vocab`][fedify-vocab] import, pull `or` into the
drizzle-orm import, and bring in the `following` schema.  Then
chain an `Accept` handler at the end of the inbox-listener chain
in *server/federation.ts*:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/federation.ts]
// @noErrors: 2304 2307
import {
  createFederation,
  InProcessMessageQueue,
  MemoryKvStore,
} from "@fedify/fedify";
import { Accept } from "@fedify/vocab";
import { eq, or } from "drizzle-orm";
import { db } from "./db/client";
import { following } from "./db/schema";

export const federation = createFederation<void>({
  kv: new MemoryKvStore(),
  queue: new InProcessMessageQueue(),
});

federation
  .setInboxListeners("/users/{identifier}/inbox", "/inbox")
// ---cut---
.on(Accept, async (ctx, accept) => {
  // The remote server has accepted alice's outbound Follow.
  // Match the Accept against our `following` row by either the
  // original Follow's `id` (when the peer echoes it) or the
  // remote actor URI (Pixelfed sometimes mints a fresh id on the
  // way back), and flip the row's status to "accepted".
  if (accept.actorId == null || accept.objectId == null) return;
  const followActivityId = accept.objectId.href;
  const remoteActorUri = accept.actorId.href;
  const matcher = accept.objectId.origin === ctx.canonicalOrigin
    ? eq(following.followActivityId, followActivityId)
    : or(
      eq(following.followActivityId, followActivityId),
      eq(following.actorUri, remoteActorUri),
    );
  await db
    .update(following)
    .set({ status: "accepted" })
    .where(matcher);
});
~~~~

`accept.objectId` reads the referenced activity's ID without trusting or
dereferencing an embedded `Follow` from another origin.  Mastodon and
GoToSocial keep the original `Follow` ID, which makes matching unambiguous.
Pixelfed often returns a freshly minted ID instead, so the remote actor URI
remains the interoperability fallback in this single-user application.  The
handler only uses that fallback for an ID minted on another origin; a mismatched
ID on our own origin is rejected instead of accepting an unrelated activity.

> [!TIP]
> If you ship multiple local users later (the closing chapter
> lists this as a stretch goal), narrow the matcher to the
> *follower* user too.  The current single-user constraint
> means an `Accept` from any peer always belongs to alice, but
> with two local accounts you must look at *who* sent the
> Follow before flipping a row.

### Trying it out

Restart the dev server, open the *Follow* page on the tunnel
URL (so alice's signature points at the canonical origin),
paste a remote handle, and click *Follow*.

#### Following an ActivityPub.Academy account

An ActivityPub.Academy account is the easiest first target:
academy auto-accepts every Follow without manual intervention:

![The Follow page after submitting “&commat;anbelia\_doshaelen&commat;activitypub.academy”, with a green confirmation banner that reads “Sent a Follow to &commat;anbelia\_doshaelen&commat;activitypub.academy.  It will move to ‘accepted’ once the remote server confirms.”](./content-sharing/follow-success.png)

The dev server narrates the round trip in real time:

~~~~ ansi [terminal]
ℹ INF fedify·federation·outbox Successfully sent activity
  'https://your-tunnel.example/users/alice#follows/1f39…'
  to 'https://activitypub.academy/users/anbelia_doshaelen/inbox'.
ℹ INF fedify·federation·inbox Activity 'https://activitypub.academy/users/anbelia_doshaelen#accepts/follows/16039'
  is enqueued.
ℹ INF fedify·federation·http 'POST' '/users/alice/inbox': 202
ℹ INF fedify·federation·inbox Activity '…#accepts/follows/16039' has been processed.
~~~~

Run a quick query to confirm the row flipped:

~~~~ sh
sqlite3 content-sharing.sqlite3 "SELECT handle, status FROM following"
~~~~

| `handle`                                 | `status`   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `@anbelia_doshaelen@activitypub.academy` | `accepted` |

#### Following a Pixelfed account

Pixelfed is the second proof point and the more important one
for this tutorial.  Submit a Pixelfed account's handle in the
same form.  The dev server logs the same shape (just to a
Pixelfed inbox), Pixelfed sends the `Accept` back essentially
instantaneously, and the row in *following* flips to
*accepted*:

~~~~ sh
sqlite3 content-sharing.sqlite3 "SELECT handle, status FROM following"
~~~~

| `handle`                                 | `status`   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `@anbelia_doshaelen@activitypub.academy` | `accepted` |
| `@tester@your-pixelfed.example`          | `accepted` |

On the Pixelfed side, log in to the account that just got
followed and open the *Notifications* page: alice's follow
appears in the list:

![Pixelfed's Notifications page showing one entry,
“&commat;alice&commat;your-tunnel.example followed
you.”](./content-sharing/pixelfed-follow-notification.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Mastodon proper sometimes takes a few seconds to send the
> `Accept`; Pixelfed is usually instantaneous.  If the row
> stays `pending`, check that the dev server's URL matches the
> URL the actor was looked up from (canonical-origin mismatch
> is the most common cause of dropped Accepts).

Now alice can follow anyone in the fediverse, but the only
proof of it is a row in SQLite.  The next chapter renders that
list as a Vue page so alice can see who she follows, and
exposes it as an ActivityPub `Following` collection so peers
can read it back.


Following list
--------------

This chapter is the symmetric counterpart of the followers list
from [*Followers list and collection*](#followers-list-and-collection):
an HTML page that shows who alice follows, plus
an ActivityPub *OrderedCollection* peers can fetch.  Both reuse
the *following* table from
[*Following remote accounts*](#following-remote-accounts),
filtered to the rows
whose status is `accepted`.

The *Unfollow* button calls a new `DELETE /api/follow` endpoint
(written below).  We track in-flight unfollows in a `pending`
Set so each row's button can disable itself independently
without freezing the whole list.

### The unfollow endpoint

Two details worth pointing out:

`followActivityId` *(round-tripped through the database)*
:   Chapter 19 stored the outbound `Follow`'s id on the
    *following* row precisely so the unfollow path can echo it
    back inside the embedded `Follow`.  Mastodon, Pixelfed, and
    GoToSocial all match incoming `Undo(Follow)` against their
    pending follow record by that id; without it the unfollow
    silently no-ops on the remote side.

*The recipient is built inline*
:   `ctx.sendActivity()` accepts any object that
    implements the `Recipient` shape (an actor `id`, an
    `inboxId`, and an optional `endpoints.sharedInbox`).  We
    have all three on the *following* row, so we hand them over
    directly and skip a `lookupObject` round trip.

### A counter on the profile

Update *server/api/users/\[username].get.ts* to surface
*followingCount* alongside the existing aggregates:

~~~~ typescript [server/api/users/&#91;username&#93;.get.ts]
import { and, count, eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { createError, defineEventHandler, getRouterParam } from "h3";
import { db } from "../../db/client";
import { followers, following, posts, users } from "../../db/schema";

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  // …user lookup unchanged…
  const [{ followerCount }] = await db
    .select({ followerCount: count() })
    .from(followers)
    .where(eq(followers.followingId, user.id));
  const [{ followingCount }] = await db
    .select({ followingCount: count() })
    .from(following)
    .where(
      and(eq(following.followerId, user.id), eq(following.status, "accepted")),
    );
  const [{ postCount }] = await db
    .select({ postCount: count() })
    .from(posts)
    .where(eq(posts.userId, user.id));
  return { user, followerCount, followingCount, postCount };
});
~~~~

Then add a third pill to the profile header in
*app/pages/users/\[username]/index.vue*:

~~~~ typescript [app/pages/users/&#91;username&#93;/index.vue]
const followingCount = computed(() => profile.value?.followingCount ?? 0);
~~~~

~~~~ html [app/pages/users/&#91;username&#93;/index.vue]
<NuxtLink
  :to="`/users/${user.username}/followers`"
  class="hover:text-brand"
>
  <strong>{{ followerCount }}</strong>
  {{ followerCount === 1 ? "follower" : "followers" }}
</NuxtLink>
<NuxtLink
  :to="`/users/${user.username}/following`"
  class="hover:text-brand"
>
  <strong>{{ followingCount }}</strong>
  following
</NuxtLink>
~~~~

The header now reads *posts · followers · following*:

![alice's profile header showing “4 posts · 2 followers · 1 following”.](./content-sharing/profile-with-following-counter.png)

Click *2 following* and the new page lists the accounts, each
with an *Unfollow* button:

![alice's Following page showing two entries: a Pixelfed
account “Tester” (&commat;tester&commat;your-pixelfed.example)
and an ActivityPub.Academy account “Anbelia Doshaelen”, each
with an Unfollow button on the
right.](./content-sharing/following-list.png)

Click *Unfollow* and the row disappears.  The dev server logs
the outbound `Undo(Follow)`:

~~~~ ansi [terminal]
ℹ INF fedify·federation·outbox Successfully sent activity
  'https://your-tunnel.example/users/alice#undo-follows/…'
  to 'https://your-pixelfed.example/users/tester/inbox'.
~~~~

Refresh the Pixelfed account's *Followers* page (or query the
database directly) and the alice row is gone.  Re-click
*Follow* on the Follow page to put the relationship back.

### The ActivityPub `Following` collection

A peer that fetches alice's actor JSON should get a `following`
URL back.  Update the actor dispatcher in *server/federation.ts*:

~~~~ typescript [server/federation.ts]
return new Person({
  // …
  followers: ctx.getFollowersUri(identifier),
  following: ctx.getFollowingUri(identifier), // [!code ++]
  // …
});
~~~~

Then add a sibling to the followers dispatcher that answers
that URL:

~~~~ typescript [server/federation.ts]
federation
  .setFollowingDispatcher(
    "/users/{identifier}/following",
    async (_ctx, identifier) => {
      const localUser = (
        await db
          .select()
          .from(users)
          .where(eq(users.username, identifier))
          .limit(1)
      )[0];
      if (localUser === undefined) return null;
      const rows = await db
        .select()
        .from(following)
        .where(
          and(
            eq(following.followerId, localUser.id),
            eq(following.status, "accepted"),
          ),
        )
        .orderBy(desc(following.createdAt));
      const items = rows.map((row) => new URL(row.actorUri));
      return { items };
    },
  )
  .setCounter(async (_ctx, identifier) => {
    const localUser = (
      await db
        .select()
        .from(users)
        .where(eq(users.username, identifier))
        .limit(1)
    )[0];
    if (localUser === undefined) return 0;
    const result = await db
      .select({ cnt: count() })
      .from(following)
      .where(
        and(
          eq(following.followerId, localUser.id),
          eq(following.status, "accepted"),
        ),
      );
    return result[0]?.cnt ?? 0;
  });
~~~~

Two differences worth pointing out compared to the followers
dispatcher:

1.  Items are *plain URL strings*, not `Recipient` objects.
    The `Recipient` shape exists so Fedify can deliver activities
    to followers; for *Following*, peers only need the actor
    URIs to fetch the actors themselves.
2.  Both the dispatcher and its counter filter by
    `status = "accepted"`.  A pending follow is not part of
    alice's public footprint until the remote server confirms.

> [!TIP]
> Fedify validates that the URL on `actor.followingId`
> matches the URL the dispatcher answers at.  If they drift
> apart (a typo, a route rename), the actor dispatcher will
> throw at startup, which is the correct moment to discover the
> mismatch.

Verify the collection serves correctly:

~~~~ sh
fedify lookup http://localhost:3000/users/alice/following
~~~~

~~~~
OrderedCollection {
  id: URL "http://localhost:3000/users/alice/following",
  totalItems: 1,
  items: [ URL "https://activitypub.academy/users/anbelia_doshaelen" ],
}
~~~~

The list is real on both sides now: alice can see it in the
browser, and any peer that walks her actor object can fetch it
through the standard ActivityPub route.  Next we make the
relationship pay off: a *home timeline* page that shows posts
the people alice follows have shared.


Home timeline
-------------

When the people alice follows post on their own servers, those
servers send `Create(Note)` activities to alice's inbox.  Up to
this chapter we ignore them.  Now we cache them in a small
*timeline\_posts* table and render the result as the *home* page,
the entry point alice lands on right after signup.

### A timeline cache table

Append to *server/db/schema.ts*:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/db/schema.ts]
import { sql } from "drizzle-orm";
import {
  check,
  integer,
  primaryKey,
  sqliteTable,
  text,
} from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

export const users = sqliteTable(
  "users",
  {
    id: integer("id").primaryKey({ autoIncrement: false }),
    username: text("username").notNull(),
    name: text("name").notNull(),
    createdAt: text("created_at").notNull().default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`),
  },
  (t) => [check("users_single_user", sql`${t.id} = 1`)],
);
// ---cut---
export const timelinePosts = sqliteTable(
  "timeline_posts",
  {
    userId: integer("user_id")
      .notNull()
      .references(() => users.id),
    noteUri: text("note_uri").notNull(),
    authorActorUri: text("author_actor_uri").notNull(),
    authorHandle: text("author_handle").notNull(),
    authorName: text("author_name"),
    authorUrl: text("author_url"),
    caption: text("caption"),
    mediaUrl: text("media_url").notNull(),
    mediaType: text("media_type").notNull(),
    publishedAt: text("published_at").notNull(),
    createdAt: text("created_at").notNull().default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`),
  },
  (t) => [primaryKey({ columns: [t.userId, t.noteUri] })],
);

export type TimelinePost = typeof timelinePosts.$inferSelect;
~~~~

Two design points worth calling out:

*Denormalized*
:   Storing *authorHandle*, *authorName*, *authorUrl* alongside
    *authorActorUri* means the home page can render entirely
    from one table.  We pay a small write cost on every inbound
    Note, but reads stay flat and a remote profile rename only
    becomes stale until the *next* post from that author refreshes
    the row.

*Composite primary key*
:   *(userId, noteUri)* makes redelivery a no-op.  Mastodon and
    Pixelfed both retry deliveries when a peer responds slowly,
    and ActivityPub permits delivering the same activity to a
    shared inbox more than once.  Without the unique key we would
    accumulate duplicates.

Push the schema:

~~~~ sh
npm run db:push
~~~~

### Sanitize remote captions before storing them

Mastodon, Pixelfed, and most other fediverse servers send
`Note.content` wrapped in HTML elements: `<p>` for paragraphs,
`<br>` for line breaks, `<a>` (often inside a `<span>`) for
mentions, hashtags, and plain links.  Rendering that markup
directly through Vue's `v-html` against a public inbox is an XSS
surface, since any peer could push markup we did not author.  We
do *not* want to throw all of that markup away either; mentions
and clickable links are part of what makes the home timeline
recognizable.  The middle ground is to run remote content through
a sanitizer with a tight allow-list at write time, and store the
cleaned HTML.

Install [sanitize-html] and its types:

~~~~ sh
npm install sanitize-html
npm install -D @types/sanitize-html
~~~~

Then add *server/utils/text.ts*:

~~~~ typescript [server/utils/text.ts]
import sanitizeHtml from "sanitize-html";

const ALLOWED_TAGS = ["p", "br", "a", "span"];
// Note: `class` is intentionally not in `allowedAttributes`; it
// is governed exclusively by `allowedClasses` below so peers can
// only surface microformats values we recognize.
const ALLOWED_ATTRS = {
  a: ["href", "rel", "target"],
};
const ALLOWED_CLASSES = {
  a: ["mention", "hashtag", "u-url"],
  span: ["h-card", "invisible", "ellipsis"],
};
const ALLOWED_SCHEMES = ["http", "https"];

export function sanitizeNoteContent(input: string): string {
  return sanitizeHtml(input, {
    allowedTags: ALLOWED_TAGS,
    allowedAttributes: ALLOWED_ATTRS,
    allowedClasses: ALLOWED_CLASSES,
    allowedSchemes: ALLOWED_SCHEMES,
    transformTags: {
      // Force a safe `rel` and `target` on every `<a>` regardless
      // of what the peer sent.  `nofollow noopener noreferrer ugc`
      // is the conventional set for user-generated remote links
      // and matches what Mastodon's web frontend renders.
      a: (_tagName, attribs) => ({
        tagName: "a",
        attribs: {
          ...attribs,
          rel: "nofollow noopener noreferrer ugc",
          target: "_blank",
        },
      }),
    },
  }).trim();
}

// Strip all markup from already-sanitized HTML so we can reuse
// the caption in places where HTML is meaningless (`alt`
// attributes, page titles, OpenGraph descriptions).  `textFilter`
// appends a space to each text node before the surrounding tags
// are removed, which keeps block boundaries from running together
// (e.g. `<p>one</p><p>two</p>` becomes `one two`, not `onetwo`).
// The trailing whitespace is collapsed by the regex below.
export function extractText(html: string): string {
  return sanitizeHtml(html, {
    allowedTags: [],
    allowedAttributes: {},
    textFilter: (text) => `${text} `,
  })
    .replace(/\s+/g, " ")
    .trim();
}
~~~~

`sanitize-html` parses the input into a DOM, walks every node
against the allow-list, and serializes the survivors back out.
Anything outside the allow-list (including `<script>`, inline
event handlers, `<img>` with hostile `src`, exotic schemes such as
`javascript:` and `data:`) is dropped.  `transformTags` rewrites
each surviving `<a>` to carry the `rel` and `target` attributes
we want; because `rel` and `target` are also listed in
`allowedAttributes.a`, the values the transform writes survive
the final attribute-allow-list pass.  `allowedClasses` keeps the
common Mastodon microformats markers (`mention`, `hashtag`,
`u-url`, `h-card`) so the rendered timeline can style them, while
dropping everything else a peer might inject.

`extractText` is a deliberately narrow companion: feeding the
already-sanitized caption back through `sanitizeHtml` with empty
allow-lists yields plain text, which is what we want for `alt`
attributes and OpenGraph descriptions where HTML is rendered as
literal characters.

### Cache inbound `Create(Note)` activities

Open *server/federation.ts* and add `Create`, `Document`, and
`Note` to the [`@fedify/vocab`][fedify-vocab] import, `and` to
the drizzle-orm import, and the `timelinePosts` table to the
schema import.  Bring in `sanitizeNoteContent` from
*./utils/text*.  Then add a `Create` handler at the end of the
inbox-listener chain (after the `Accept` handler from
[*Following remote accounts*](#following-remote-accounts)):

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/federation.ts]
// @noErrors: 2304 2307
import {
  createFederation,
  InProcessMessageQueue,
  MemoryKvStore,
} from "@fedify/fedify";
import { Create, Document, Note } from "@fedify/vocab";
import { and, eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { db } from "./db/client";
import { following, timelinePosts } from "./db/schema";
import { sanitizeNoteContent } from "./utils/text";

export const federation = createFederation<void>({
  kv: new MemoryKvStore(),
  queue: new InProcessMessageQueue(),
});

federation
  .setInboxListeners("/users/{identifier}/inbox", "/inbox")
// ---cut---
.on(Create, async (_ctx, create) => {
  // A remote actor has authored something.  We only cache it if
  // (a) the object is a Note, (b) the author is one of our
  // accepted followees, and (c) the Note has at least one image
  // Document attachment we can show in the grid.
  if (create.actorId == null) return;
  const object = await create.getObject();
  if (!(object instanceof Note)) return;
  if (object.id == null) return;
  const actorRows = await db
    .select()
    .from(following)
    .where(
      and(
        eq(following.actorUri, create.actorId.href),
        eq(following.status, "accepted"),
      ),
    );
  if (actorRows.length === 0) return;
  let mediaUrl: string | null = null;
  let mediaType: string | null = null;
  for await (const attachment of object.getAttachments()) {
    if (
      attachment instanceof Document &&
      attachment.url instanceof URL &&
      attachment.mediaType?.startsWith("image/")
    ) {
      mediaUrl = attachment.url.href;
      mediaType = attachment.mediaType;
      break;
    }
  }
  if (mediaUrl == null || mediaType == null) return;
  const published =
    object.published?.toString() ?? new Date().toISOString();
  for (const row of actorRows) {
    await db
      .insert(timelinePosts)
      .values({
        userId: row.followerId,
        noteUri: object.id.href,
        authorActorUri: row.actorUri,
        authorHandle: row.handle,
        authorName: row.name,
        authorUrl: row.url,
        caption: sanitizeNoteContent(object.content?.toString() ?? "") || null,
        mediaUrl,
        mediaType,
        publishedAt: published,
      })
      .onConflictDoNothing();
  }
});
~~~~

Three guards keep the table tidy:

1.  `getObject()` returns the embedded Note.  We use
    `instanceof Note` rather than a string compare on
    `type` because Fedify hands us strongly-typed objects;
    relying on the class is more robust to JSON-LD reshapes.
2.  We filter by author URI on the *following* table, with the
    *accepted* gate.  This rejects activities from anyone we are
    not deliberately following, which means random
    follower-of-a-follower posts that arrive at our shared inbox
    do *not* end up on the home grid.
3.  `getAttachments()` is an async iterator.  We pull the first
    image-shaped attachment and stop.  PxShare is single-image,
    so dropping further attachments is fine for this tutorial;
    the closing chapter lists multi-image carousels as a stretch
    goal.

> [!NOTE]
> Mastodon's status URLs and the underlying activity URLs are
> different.  The activity has *…/statuses/&lt;id&gt;/activity*
> as its id; the embedded Note is *…/statuses/&lt;id&gt;*.  Our
> handler stores the *Note*'s id in *noteUri* (so the row links
> back to the user-visible status, not the federation envelope).

### A home-page endpoint and view

Create *server/api/home.get.ts*:

~~~~ typescript [server/api/home.get.ts]
import { desc, eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { createError, defineEventHandler } from "h3";
import { db } from "../db/client";
import { timelinePosts } from "../db/schema";
import { extractText } from "../utils/text";
import { getLocalUser } from "../utils/users";

export default defineEventHandler(async () => {
  const user = await getLocalUser();
  if (user == null) {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 403, statusMessage: "No user" });
  }
  const rows = await db
    .select()
    .from(timelinePosts)
    .where(eq(timelinePosts.userId, user.id))
    .orderBy(desc(timelinePosts.publishedAt))
    .limit(60);
  return {
    posts: rows.map((row) => ({
      ...row,
      // `caption` is sanitized HTML for `v-html`; `captionText`
      // is the same content stripped to plain text for the
      // `alt` attribute and other text-only spots.
      captionText: row.caption ? extractText(row.caption) : null,
    })),
  };
});
~~~~

Then *app/pages/home.vue*:

~~~~ vue [app/pages/home.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { data } = await useFetch("/api/home", { key: "home-timeline" });
const posts = computed(() => data.value?.posts ?? []);

useHead({ title: "Home · PxShare" });
</script>

<template>
  <section class="flex flex-col gap-6">

### Wire `/home` as the entry point

Update the navbar in *app/app.vue* and the redirect in
*app/pages/index.vue* so the home grid is the first thing alice
sees on every login:

~~~~ html [app/app.vue]
<nav class="flex items-center gap-4 text-sm">
  <NuxtLink to="/home" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-brand">
    Home
  </NuxtLink>
  <NuxtLink to="/follow" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-brand">
    Follow
  </NuxtLink>
  <NuxtLink
    to="/compose"
    class="px-3 py-1.5 bg-brand text-white rounded-full hover:bg-brand-dark"
  >
    Compose
  </NuxtLink>
</nav>
~~~~

~~~~ typescript [app/pages/index.vue]
if (data.value?.user) {
  await navigateTo("/home", { replace: true });
}
~~~~

### Trying it out

Restart the dev server and post a photo from a Pixelfed account
that alice follows (*Following remote accounts* covers the
follow flow).  Within a second or two alice's home page lights
up: the 3-column grid renders one square thumbnail of the new
photo, and clicking it opens the original on Pixelfed.  We will
rework this layout into stacked cards in
[*`Like`s and `Undo(Like)`*](#likes-and-undo-like) so that
hearts have somewhere to live; the screenshot below shows the
later card form with two timeline entries, which is what alice
ends up looking at after chapter 22.

![alice's home page rendered as a stacked single-column feed of
two timeline cards: tester's foggy beach photograph from Pixelfed
with the caption “Photo from tester for federation testing.” and
a “0 likes” counter on top, and anbelia\_doshaelen's space scene
with “1 like” underneath.](./content-sharing/home-with-pixelfed-post.png)

The dev server narrates the inbound activity, and the database
gains a row:

~~~~ ansi [terminal]
ℹ INF fedify·federation·inbox Activity 'https://your-pixelfed.example/p/tester/953…/activity'
  is enqueued.
ℹ INF fedify·federation·http 'POST' '/inbox': 202
ℹ INF fedify·federation·inbox Activity '…/activity' has been processed.
~~~~

~~~~ sh
sqlite3 content-sharing.sqlite3 "SELECT note_uri, author_handle FROM timeline_posts"
~~~~

| `note_uri`                                    | `author_handle`                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `https://your-pixelfed.example/p/tester/953…` | `@tester@your-pixelfed.example` |

Posts arrive in real time: no polling, no scheduled job.  The
fediverse pushed the activity to alice the instant Pixelfed
queued the delivery, and the only thing we added was a strict
little filter on top of the inbox listener chain.


`Like`s and `Undo(Like)`
------------------------

A `Like` activity is the fediverse's heart button.  This chapter
makes it work in both directions: alice can heart a remote post
from her home grid, and remote actors can heart alice's posts.
`Undo(Like)` reverses either action.

### A bidirectional `likes` table

Append to *server/db/schema.ts*:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/db/schema.ts]
import { sql } from "drizzle-orm";
import { primaryKey, sqliteTable, text } from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";
// ---cut---
export const likes = sqliteTable(
  "likes",
  {
    actorUri: text("actor_uri").notNull(),
    noteUri: text("note_uri").notNull(),
    likeActivityId: text("like_activity_id").notNull(),
    createdAt: text("created_at").notNull().default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`),
  },
  (t) => [primaryKey({ columns: [t.actorUri, t.noteUri] })],
);

export type Like = typeof likes.$inferSelect;
~~~~

One row per (actor, note) pair, regardless of who is local.
`like_activity_id` is what we use to match an `Undo(Like)`
back to the row that should disappear.  Push the schema:

~~~~ sh
npm run db:push
~~~~

### Outbound: alice likes a remote post

Create *server/api/likes.post.ts*:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/api/likes.post.ts]
// @noErrors: 2304 2307
import { isActor, Like } from "@fedify/vocab";
import { and, eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import {
  createError,
  defineEventHandler,
  readBody,

A few design notes:

`returning()` *short-circuits duplicate clicks*
:   `onConflictDoNothing()` keeps the existing row's
    `like_activity_id` when the same `(actorUri, noteUri)` already
    exists, but the in-flight handler has already minted a fresh
    UUID for this request.  If we naively fell through to
    `sendActivity`, a second click (or a retry after a network
    blip) would deliver a `Like` with a different id than the one
    we record, and a later `Undo(Like)` would only retract the
    first delivery.  `.returning()` is empty on conflict, so we
    return early and the duplicate POST becomes a no-op.

`isActor()`
:   `lookupObject()` is typed broadly because the URI could in
    principle resolve to anything (a Note, a Collection).
    `isActor()` from [`@fedify/vocab`][fedify-vocab] narrows it down to
    `Application | Group | Organization | Person | Service`.
    If the lookup somehow returns a Note we silently skip
    delivery; the local row still flips, which is the user's
    intent.

`Undo(Like)` *wraps the original Like*
:   We rebuild the `Like` with the original `id` so peers that
    match by activity id (Mastodon does) line up with the row
    they recorded earlier.

### Inbound: receive `Like`s and `Undo(Like)`

Two changes in *server/federation.ts*.  First, add `Like` to
the [`@fedify/vocab`][fedify-vocab] import (alongside `Follow`, `Note`, etc.).
Second, prepend a new `Undo(Like)` branch to the existing
`Undo` listener so the `Undo(Follow)` body from
[*Handling unfollows*](#handling-unfollows) keeps working
unchanged.  A separate top-level `Like` listener at the end of
the chain records inbound likes themselves.

The `Like` handler does not gate by *is the object one of our
local posts*.  Storing every like is cheap; the post-detail
page only counts rows whose `note_uri` matches its own canonical
URI, so cross-Talk never leaks across posts.

> [!TIP]
> The fallback id `${actor}#${object}` exists because some
> peers (Pleroma, older Friendica) drop the `Like.id` entirely.
> Building a synthetic id keeps the upsert deterministic so the
> row stays unique even when nothing global addresses it.

### Show like counts

Update *server/api/home.get.ts* to fold the like aggregates
into each timeline row.  We compute alice's canonical actor URI
from the request URL so the same code works behind a tunnel or
on localhost:

~~~~ typescript [server/api/home.get.ts]
import { and, count, desc, eq, inArray } from "drizzle-orm";
import {
  createError,
  defineEventHandler,
  getRequestProtocol,
  getRequestURL,
} from "h3";
import { db } from "../db/client";
import { likes, timelinePosts } from "../db/schema";
import { extractText } from "../utils/text";
import { getLocalUser } from "../utils/users";

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const user = await getLocalUser();
  if (user == null) {
    throw createError({ statusCode: 403, statusMessage: "No user" });
  }
  const rows = await db
    .select()
    .from(timelinePosts)
    .where(eq(timelinePosts.userId, user.id))
    .orderBy(desc(timelinePosts.publishedAt))
    .limit(60);
  if (rows.length === 0) return { posts: [] };

  const origin = `${getRequestProtocol(event)}://${getRequestURL(event).host}`;
  const aliceActorUri = `${origin}/users/${user.username}`;
  const noteUris = rows.map((r) => r.noteUri);

  const likeCounts = await db
    .select({ noteUri: likes.noteUri, cnt: count() })
    .from(likes)
    .where(inArray(likes.noteUri, noteUris))
    .groupBy(likes.noteUri);
  const myLikes = await db
    .select({ noteUri: likes.noteUri })
    .from(likes)
    .where(
      and(eq(likes.actorUri, aliceActorUri), inArray(likes.noteUri, noteUris)),
    );

  const countMap = new Map(likeCounts.map((r) => [r.noteUri, r.cnt]));
  const mySet = new Set(myLikes.map((r) => r.noteUri));
  return {
    posts: rows.map((row) => ({
      ...row,
      // `caption` is sanitized HTML for `v-html`; `captionText`
      // is the same content stripped to plain text so it can ride
      // along into the `alt` attribute and other text-only spots.
      captionText: row.caption ? extractText(row.caption) : null,
      likeCount: countMap.get(row.noteUri) ?? 0,
      likedByMe: mySet.has(row.noteUri),
    })),
  };
});
~~~~

Apply the same trick to the local post detail endpoint so
alice's profile shows like counts on her own posts.  Pull
`count` into the drizzle-orm imports, `getRequestProtocol` and
`getRequestURL` into the h3 imports, and `likes` into the
schema imports, then add the lookup just before the response:

~~~~ typescript [server/api/users/&#91;username&#93;/posts/&#91;id&#93;.get.ts]
import { and, count, eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import {
  createError,
  defineEventHandler,
  getRequestProtocol,
  getRequestURL,
  getRouterParam,
} from "h3";
import { likes /* …existing imports… */ } from "../../../../db/schema";
// …
const origin = `${getRequestProtocol(event)}://${getRequestURL(event).host}`;
const noteUri = `${origin}/users/${username}/posts/${id}`;
const [{ likeCount }] = await db
  .select({ likeCount: count() })
  .from(likes)
  .where(eq(likes.noteUri, noteUri));
return { user, post, likeCount };
~~~~

### Wire the heart button

Replace the contents of *app/pages/home.vue* with a single-column
feed that carries a heart per post.  The script types the timeline
entries with a `TimelineEntry` shape, pulls `refresh` out of
`useFetch`, and adds a `toggleLike` helper that POSTs or DELETEs
*/api/likes* depending on the current state:

~~~~ vue [app/pages/home.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
type TimelineEntry = {
  noteUri: string;
  authorHandle: string;
  authorName: string | null;
  authorUrl: string | null;
  caption: string | null;
  captionText: string | null;
  mediaUrl: string;
  likeCount: number;
  likedByMe: boolean;
};

const { data, refresh } = await useFetch<{ posts: TimelineEntry[] }>(
  "/api/home",
  { key: "home-timeline" },
);
const posts = computed(() => data.value?.posts ?? []);

async function toggleLike(post: TimelineEntry) {
  const method = post.likedByMe ? "DELETE" : "POST";
  await $fetch("/api/likes", {
    method,
    body: { noteUri: post.noteUri },
  });
  await refresh();
}

useHead({ title: "Home · PxShare" });

A small addition to *app/pages/users/\[username]/posts/\[id].vue*
surfaces the count on alice's own posts.  Add a `likeCount`
computed alongside the others in `<script setup>`:

~~~~ typescript [app/pages/users/&#91;username&#93;/posts/&#91;id&#93;.vue]
const likeCount = computed(() => data.value?.likeCount ?? 0); // [!code ++]
~~~~

Then render it inside `<template>` between the caption paragraph
and the *Posted …* timestamp:

<p class="text-sm text-gray-500">

  {{ likeCount }}
  {{ likeCount === 1 ? "like" : "likes" }}
</p>

### Trying it out

#### Outbound: alice likes a Pixelfed post

Click the heart on a Pixelfed-sourced tile in alice's home
grid.  The button fills in, the counter ticks up, and the dev
log shows the outbound `Like`:

~~~~ ansi [terminal]
ℹ INF fedify·federation·outbox Successfully sent activity
  'https://your-tunnel.example/users/alice#likes/8b288acb-…'
  to 'https://your-pixelfed.example/users/tester/inbox'.
~~~~

Open the original post on Pixelfed: the like appears under the
photo (*Liked by alice*, *1 Like*) and a notification flags
*&commat;alice liked your post* in the right column.

![Pixelfed's post detail page for tester's beach photo,
showing a “Liked by alice” line, a “1 Like” counter, and a
right-column notification saying “&commat;alice liked your
post”.](./content-sharing/pixelfed-post-with-like.png)

#### Inbound: a Pixelfed account likes alice's post

For the reverse direction, log in to a Pixelfed account that
follows alice and click the heart on alice's photo there.
Pixelfed sends a `Like` to alice's inbox; our handler stores the
row, and alice's post detail page on PxShare shows *1 like* the
next time it loads:

![alice's post detail page on PxShare showing her foggy beach
photo with caption “Pixelfed federation debug post.”, a filled
red heart icon and “1 like” beneath it; the like came from the
&commat;tester Pixelfed
account.](./content-sharing/post-detail-with-like.png)

Click the heart again on either side to unlike: the counter
decrements on PxShare immediately, and an `Undo(Like)` flies out
signed with alice's keys.  The dev server log confirms the
delivery, and alice's local row disappears.

Comments
--------

A comment in ActivityPub is just a `Note` whose
`replyTarget` (`inReplyTo` in JSON-LD) points at the parent
post.  Caching them and rendering them as a thread on the post
detail page is the last federation feature this tutorial
covers.

### A `comments` table

Append to *server/db/schema.ts*:

~~~~ typescript twoslash [server/db/schema.ts]
import { sql } from "drizzle-orm";
import { sqliteTable, text } from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";
// ---cut---
export const comments = sqliteTable("comments", {
  noteUri: text("note_uri").primaryKey(),
  inReplyToUri: text("in_reply_to_uri").notNull(),
  authorActorUri: text("author_actor_uri").notNull(),
  authorHandle: text("author_handle").notNull(),
  authorName: text("author_name"),
  authorUrl: text("author_url"),
  content: text("content").notNull(),
  publishedAt: text("published_at").notNull(),
  // Populated only for alice's outbound replies to remote posts.
  // The Note object dispatcher reads these back to rebuild the
  // `cc` audience and the `Mention` tag when a peer like Pixelfed
  // refetches the comment by URL.
  replyAuthorActorUri: text("reply_author_actor_uri"),
  replyAuthorMention: text("reply_author_mention"),
  createdAt: text("created_at").notNull().default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`),
});

export type Comment = typeof comments.$inferSelect;
~~~~

`note_uri` is unique because every Note has a globally
addressable id.  Push the schema:

~~~~ sh
npm run db:push
~~~~

### Branch the `Create(Note)` handler

The same `Create` listener that caches top-level posts must
now route comments into the new table.  Open
*server/federation.ts* and update the listener:

`ctx.parseUri(url)` is the easy way to ask “is this
URL one I would dispatch to?”  When the parsed `class` is
`Note`, the URL belongs to one of alice's local posts; we
accept the comment unconditionally.  For remote parents we
require the post already to be in the timeline cache, which is
a soft “alice has expressed interest in this conversation”
filter.

### Surface comments on the post detail page

Update
*server/api/users/\[username]/posts/\[id].get.ts*
to pull the matching rows:

~~~~ typescript [server/api/users/&#91;username&#93;/posts/&#91;id&#93;.get.ts]
import { and, asc, count, eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { comments /* …existing imports… */ } from "../../../../db/schema";
// …
const commentRows = await db
  .select()
  .from(comments)
  .where(eq(comments.inReplyToUri, noteUri))
  .orderBy(asc(comments.publishedAt));
return { user, post, likeCount, comments: commentRows };
~~~~

Then update *app/pages/users/\[username]/posts/\[id].vue*.  The
script grows a `Comment` type, pulls `refresh` out of the
existing `useFetch` destructure so we can reload the page after
sending, and gains a `noteUri` computed, a `submitComment`
handler, and the local form state.  Add the new declarations
alongside the existing ones in `<script setup>`:

~~~~ typescript [app/pages/users/&#91;username&#93;/posts/&#91;id&#93;.vue]
type Comment = {
  noteUri: string;
  authorHandle: string;
  authorName: string | null;
  authorUrl: string | null;
  content: string;
  publishedAt: string;
};

// Add `refresh` to the existing `useFetch` destructure:
//   const { data, error, refresh } = await useFetch(...)

const comments = computed<Comment[]>(() => data.value?.comments ?? []);
const noteUri = computed(() => {
  if (!user.value || !post.value) return "";
  if (typeof window === "undefined") return "";
  return `${window.location.origin}/users/${user.value.username}/posts/${post.value.id}`;
});

const commentDraft = ref("");
const submitting = ref(false);

async function submitComment() {
  if (commentDraft.value.trim() === "") return;
  if (noteUri.value === "") return;
  submitting.value = true;
  try {
    await $fetch("/api/comments", {
      method: "POST",
      body: { inReplyToUri: noteUri.value, content: commentDraft.value.trim() },
    });
    commentDraft.value = "";
    await refresh();
  } finally {
    submitting.value = false;
  }
}
~~~~

The template grows a `<section>` that lists the cached replies
and ends in the textarea form.  Append it inside the existing
`<article>`, after the *Posted …* timestamp:

~~~~ html [app/pages/users/&#91;username&#93;/posts/&#91;id&#93;.vue]
<section class="flex flex-col gap-3 border-t border-gray-200 pt-4">

The shape mirrors the `posts.post.ts` handler from
[*Distributing new posts to followers*](#distributing-new-posts-to-followers),
with three differences:

1.  The recipient depends on whether the parent is a local post
    (deliver to *followers*) or a remote post (deliver to the
    parent's author).
2.  The Note carries `replyTarget` so peers thread it under the
    right parent.
3.  When the parent is remote, the Note also `cc`s the parent
    author and carries a `Mention` tag for them.  Pixelfed and
    Mastodon both gate inbound replies on this addressing, so
    omitting the mention silently drops the comment from the
    thread on those servers even though the inbox returns 200.

### Extend the `Note` object dispatcher to serve comments

Pixelfed re-fetches the comment Note by URL when it threads a
reply, so the UUID-based comment URI we mint above must resolve
through the same `setObjectDispatcher(Note, …)` call from
[*`Note` object dispatcher*](#note-object-dispatcher).  Fedify
only allows one dispatcher per `Note` class; instead of
registering a second route, branch the existing dispatcher on
the id shape.  Add `Mention` to the
[`@fedify/vocab`][fedify-vocab] import (alongside `Note` and
`PUBLIC_COLLECTION`) and `comments` to the schema import:

~~~~

Sharing the URL space keeps the route table tidy and lets
peers crawl back to any single comment by URL.  The numeric-vs-
UUID branch is unambiguous:
[*Image post schema*](#image-post-schema)'s posts table uses
auto-incrementing integers, and `crypto.randomUUID()` always
contains hyphens, so `Number(id)` is `NaN` for comments.

### Trying it out

#### Outbound: alice replies on her own post

Open one of alice's posts in PxShare and write a comment.  The
button greys out for a moment while Fedify signs and dispatches
the activity, then the page refreshes with the new comment
inline:

![alice's post detail page with a “1 comment” header and a
single-comment card showing alice's own reply, “Reply from alice
on her own beach photo.”, followed by an empty
textarea.](./content-sharing/post-detail-with-comment.png)

The dev server logs the outbound delivery; alice's followers on
Pixelfed thread the reply under the original post.

#### Outbound: alice replies to a Pixelfed post

Comments work in the other direction too.  From the home grid,
note the URI of a Pixelfed-sourced tile and POST it as
`inReplyToUri` to */api/comments* (the closing chapter lists
adding a per-tile reply form as a small follow-up).  The dev
server logs the same activity shape, and Pixelfed threads the
reply under the original photo with a *1 Comment* counter and a
*&commat;alice commented on your post* notification:

![Pixelfed's post detail page showing tester's beach photo, a
“1 Comment” counter, and beneath it alice's reply
“&commat;alice&commat;your-tunnel.example—Reply from alice
on PxShare to a Pixelfed
post.”](./content-sharing/pixelfed-post-with-alice-comment.png)

#### Inbound: a Pixelfed account replies to alice's post

Reply to alice's post from a Pixelfed account that follows her.
Pixelfed delivers a `Create(Note)` whose `inReplyTo` points at
alice's post URI; our listener stores the comment, and alice's
post detail page now shows the Pixelfed reply threaded beneath
the photo:

![alice's post detail page showing one comment whose author is
&commat;tester&commat;your-pixelfed.example with the body “Reply
from tester on Pixelfed - federation works!” rendered above the
comment textarea.](./content-sharing/post-detail-with-pixelfed-comment.png)


Where next
----------

PxShare is a real federated image-sharing service: alice can
post photos, follow accounts on Mastodon and Pixelfed, see
their photos in her home timeline, and trade likes and
comments with the rest of the fediverse.  Roughly 750 lines of
TypeScript stand between the `fedify init` scaffold and that
shipping product.

That said, every line of PxShare exists because it teaches
something about Fedify, not because it is production-ready.
The list below is what you would change next, ordered roughly
from “afternoon project” to “weekend sprint”, with pointers
into the Fedify manual where each item is documented in
detail.

### Polish that costs an afternoon

*A reply form on the home grid*
:   Chapter 23 wires up a comment textarea on alice's own post
    detail page, but commenting on a remote post still requires
    POSTing to */api/comments* by hand.  Add a small form per
    home-grid tile that fills in `inReplyToUri` automatically.

*Multi-image posts*
:   The *posts* schema and the `buildNote` helper both assume
    one media path per post.  Loosen them and append every
    `Document` to `attachments` so a post can carry a
    carousel.  Pixelfed natively renders multi-attachment Notes;
    Mastodon renders the first four.

*Edit and delete*
:   `Update(Note)` and `Delete(Note)` are the relevant
    activities.  Mirror the *Compose* form for editing, send
    the activity to followers, and the rest of the fediverse
    rewrites the cached copy in place.

*Pagination*
:   `setFollowersDispatcher` and `setFollowingDispatcher`
    accept a *cursor*; passing it through into the SQL query
    keeps memory flat for accounts with thousands of followers.
    The same applies to the home timeline grid.  See
    [*Collections*](../manual/collections.md) in the manual.

### Mid-size additions

*Multiple local users*
:   The *users* table has a `CHECK (id = 1)` constraint that
    closes the door on more than one account.  Drop the check,
    add a real password / OAuth flow, and route most queries by
    `user_id` consistently.  The actor dispatcher already
    accepts an `identifier`, so most of the wiring scales for
    free.

`Announce` *(boosts)*
:   The boost button on Mastodon and Pixelfed maps to an
    `Announce` activity wrapping the original Note.  Add a
    *boosts* table keyed on (actor, note), an inbound listener
    that records remote boosts, and an outbound endpoint that
    sends `Announce` to alice's followers.

*Direct messages*
:   A Note whose `to` is a specific actor (instead of
    *Public*) is a DM.  Add an inbox listener that detects
    that shape and routes the Note into a separate
    *direct\_messages* table; surface it on a *Messages* page
    with a list of conversation partners.

*Live updates*
:   Refreshing the home page to see new posts is the lowest
    common denominator.  Push fresh rows to connected clients
    over an SSE endpoint or websocket, fed from the same inbox
    listener that writes to *timeline\_posts*.

### Production-quality work

*Persistent KV and queue*
:   `MemoryKvStore` and `InProcessMessageQueue` are perfect
    for a tutorial; in production replace them with the
    Postgres, Redis, or RabbitMQ adapter from the `@fedify`
    family of packages.  Activities you have already enqueued
    survive restarts that way.

*Authorized fetch and rate limits*
:   Mastodon's *secure mode* requires every actor fetch to be
    HTTP-signed by the requesting actor.  Fedify already signs
    when you pass a `documentLoader`, but you should also
    apply rate limits at the inbox endpoint to keep the
    federation queue healthy.

*Moderation*
:   `Block` and `Flag` are first-class activities.  An
    inbound `Block` should drop deliveries from the blocked
    actor; outbound `Flag` reports content to the destination
    server's moderators.

*Object integrity proofs*
:   FEP-8b32 attaches a verifiable signature to every object,
    not just the HTTP request.  Fedify supports it through the
    proof-normalization opt-in.

### Beyond pxshare

Take a look at the [microblog tutorial](./microblog.md) for
a parallel walk-through that ends in a Mastodon-style timeline
rather than a grid; it covers some material this tutorial
intentionally skipped, like WebFinger plumbing and Hashtag
handling.

The Fedify manual is the authoritative reference for the bits
we used in passing.  Bookmark the [*Federation*](../manual/federation.md) and
[*Vocabulary*](../manual/vocab.md) sections in particular; once you start adding
activities, you will visit them often.

Finally, when something does not work between two servers, the
[FEP] index is where the fediverse codifies how things *should*
work.  Reading the FEPs that cover the activities you are
